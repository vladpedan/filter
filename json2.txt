Your attorney can present your diary to the court as evidence of the injuries you have suffered and the treatments you have undertaken. It also shows the financial expenses you have incurred and the impact of the injury on your work and quality of life. It can also help you track your progress and identify things that are helping you heal, and things that aren't helping as much as they could.</p><h3>Documentation to Include</h3><p>Your recovery diary should include a copy of any police reports or workers' compensation forms related to your injury. These provide a foundation for your claim as they can establish the who's, what's, when's, where's, and how's of a <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/blog/when-call-catastrophic-injury-attorney\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/blog/when-call-catastrophic-injury-attorney\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"When to Call a Catastrophic Injury Attorney \">personal injury lawsuit</a>. </p><p>You should also include copies of your medical records and medical bills. It is also helpful to include a detailed accounting of your medical expenses including those related to emergency medical care, therapeutic treatments, and prescription medications.</p><p>Alongside your accounting of medical expenses, we recommend keeping an accounting of the financial losses you have incurred. These can include lost wages supported with pay stubs, receipts for insurance deductibles you've paid out-of-pocket, confirmations of vacation cancellations, etc.</p><p>It is also advisable to include photos and video evidence in your diary. If you keep these on an SD card, make sure that you have two copies as these small devices are easily misplaced, lost, or recorded over.</p><p>Finally, you will want to write in your diary. Include information about the effectiveness of treatments, any pain you experience, your mood, and the impact of the injury on your ability to perform work or enjoy favorite activities. </p><h3>Organizing and Storing Your Diary</h3><p>You will want to keep your recovery diary organized. Start by getting two large binders with pocket folders that you can use to store receipts. You will want to keep one original diary, and one copy that you regularly update. These two diaries should be kept in a different place that is safe and secure. This helps ensure that even if the original is lost, you have a copy to fall back on.</p><p><a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Contact Sloat &amp; Nicholson, P.C.\">Sloat and Nicholson, P.C.</a> can help you document your recovery process.

To that end, there are certain steps you should take promptly following a dog bite and before contacting a dog bite attorney. </p><h3>Exchange Information</h3><p>Never leave the scene of a dog bite without exchanging complete contact information with the dog's owner or caretaker. You will want to verify the individual's name, address, and phone number before leaving the scene. Similarly, make sure that you collect the contact information of any eyewitnesses. </p><h3>Seek Medical Care</h3><p>Rabies is more common in neighboring Larimer County than in Boulder. It is something to be cognizant of, but not overly concerned over. However, there are still plenty of potentially dangerous aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, as well as viruses that a dog bite can transmit which can cause serious infections. All dog bites should be cleaned and treated by a medical professional. In addition to helping you heal, your medical records provide formal documentation of the injury that your dog bite attorney can use as evidence. </p><h3>Report the Bite to Animal Control or the Police</h3><p>All dog bites should be reported to Boulder County Animal Control by calling (303) 441-3626 or (303) 441-4444. They are responsible for investigating incidents in Boulder County including Lyons, Superior, and Jamestown. </p><p>If the bite occurred in the cities of Boulder, Erie, Lafayette, Longmont, Louisville, or Nederland, you should contact the police department. As with your medical records, your dog bite attorney should receive a copy of the BCAC or police report to support your claim. </p><h3>Start a Diary</h3><p>You will want to document your recovery process. Your diary should include the full extent of your injuries and their healing. You should write about the impact the injury has on your ability to work, engage in activities, perform errands, etc. As part of your diary, you should also keep a detailed accounting of your expenses including medical care, prescriptions, physical therapy, etc. </p><p>Don't dawdle when Fifi or Fido don't play nice. <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Contact Sloat &amp; Nicholson, P.C.\">Contact Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at (800) 873-3202 for a free consultation with a dog bite attorney.

    "text": "<p>It is quite possible that you will be deposed as you pursue your personal injury lawsuit. Depositions are a crucial part of the legal process and it is natural to be apprehensive about how the deposition will be conducted and what you can expect. While you may have visions of metal tables in smoke filled rooms illuminated by floodlights, the reality is much more relaxed. Before your deposition, your civil attorney will help prepare you for the meeting. They will also guide and protect you throughout the deposition so that you can stay comfortable and relaxed.</p><h3>The Purpose of Depositions</h3><p>Depositions provide an opportunity to gather the statements of witnesses, the plaintiff(s), and the defendant(s). It is part of the discovery process and allows attorneys to record testimony and gather facts. Because depositions are conducted under oath, the information that is shared can be presented during the trial. Everything that is said or shared during a deposition should be considered \"on the record.\"</p><h3>Staying Calm, Collected, and on Course</h3><p><strong>Tell the Truth -</strong> It helps to think of a deposition as nothing more than a discussion. Admittedly, it's a conversation where you must watch your words carefully. Because you will be under oath, you can be subject to perjury charges and criminal sanctions if you don't tell the truth. Thus, it's crucial to be honest and professional with all of your answers. </p><p><strong>Think First, Speak Second -</strong> Always consider the question and think over your answer before you speak. This will help ensure you don't overshare information and the process of thinking over your answer can help you stay relaxed and focused. It also gives your attorney an opportunity to object to the question if it is inapplicable or irrelevant to the lawsuit.</p><p><strong>Keep It Short and Sweet -</strong> Your answers should be short, sweet, and to the point. \"Yes,\" \"no,\" \"maybe,\" and \"I don't know\" are perfectly acceptable answers in a deposition. Unless otherwise required to explain a process or procedure, be very careful volunteering information that opposing counsel can use to sink your claim. Under no circumstances should you ever guess an answer or let opposing counsel put words in your mouth.</p><p>Sloat &amp; Nicholson, P.C. can help you pursue compensation for a personal injury claim in Colorado. <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Contact Sloat &amp; Nicholson, P.C.\" style=\"background-color: white;\">Contact us</a> at (800) 873-3202 and a civil attorney will review your case and explain your legal options to you.</p>"

    "text": "<p>Expanded light rail and bus service in the Denver-Boulder region has made it easier for commuters, students, and tourists to get around the area. While enhanced public transit options have eased some issues, this expansion has come at a price. There have been multiple incidents in the past decade where the courts have found RTD at fault for causing injury and fatality accidents involving motorists, passengers, and <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/blog/what-causes-pedestrian-accident\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/blog/what-causes-pedestrian-accident\" target=\"_blank\">pedestrians</a>. </p><h3>Causes of Public Transit Accidents</h3><p>There are many causes of accidents involving RTD trains and buses. These include distractions while operating the vehicle, engineer/driver errors, equipment failures, as well as damaged rails. In some instances, track defects including faulty rail switches and malfunctioning crossing gates can cause or contribute to causing an accident. </p><h3>Negligence Puts the Public at Risk</h3><p>Many public transit accidents are the result of negligence on the part of the transportation provider. In 2015, the <a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/audits/1421p_regional_transportation_district_performance_audit_october_2015.pdf\" href=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/audits/1421p_regional_transportation_district_performance_audit_october_2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"2015 RTD Audit \">Colorado Office of the State Auditor</a> determined that RTD needed to enhance enforcement of rules regarding the use of electronic devices while operating buses and trains. </p><p>The audit also determined that RTD was not sufficiently monitoring and conducting oversight over private carriers contracted by RTD to perform services. These violations included failing to ensure physical fitness, performing drug/alcohol testing, and restricting operators to hours of duty limits established by the federal government. It remains to be seen whether RTD has corrected these deficiencies and the next audit required by Colorado statutes is not scheduled to take place until 2020. </p><h3>Short Timelines and Liability Limits for Public Transit Claims</h3><p>If you are in an accident involving an RTD train or bus, Colorado statutes require you to file your notice of claim within six months of the incident. If you fail to file your notice, the court is likely to dismiss the claim. This is because RTD is considered a government entity and thus covered by the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act. </p><p>Additionally, it is important to know that liability is limited in claims filed against RTD. Under the statutes, RTD can only be held responsible for up to $150,000 per person, or $600,000 per accident. </p><p>Sloat &amp; Nicholson, P.C. can help you pursue compensation following a public transit accident. <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Contact Sloat &amp; Nicholson, P.C.\">Contact us</a> to schedule a free consultation to discuss the facts of your case and the legal options available to you. </p>"

    "header": "Comparative Negligence and Accident Claims in Colorado",
    "text": "<p>It is crucial to understand the law when filing an accident claim in Colorado following a motor vehicle collision. In particular, individuals should understand that Colorado follows a modified comparative negligence rule. This rule is used to determine how much an injured party can collect for their injuries, property damage, etc. Depending on the facts of your case, it can have a significant influence on your award.</p><h3>Comparative Negligence in Colorado</h3><p>Colorado statutes specify that individuals can recover damages in an accident claim proportional to the degree of negligence of both parties in a motor vehicle accident. In an accident case, the judge or jury will first determine the total amount of damages that would be awarded if the injured party bore no fault for the accident.</p><p>Once this sum is determined, the judge or jury will then calculate the amount of fault the injured driver has in causing the accident. For example, if the court decides that an injured party's damages amount to $1 million, but they are responsible for 30% of the accident, the $1 million award will be reduced by 30% to $700,000. </p><p>If it is determined that the injured party is 51% or more at fault, they will not be able to recover compensation for their claim. In these circumstances, the court essentially rules that the individual is responsible for causing their own injuries. </p><h3>Establishing Fault for an Accident</h3><p>Evidence collection is crucial in determining fault for an accident claim. This can include video evidence, photographs, witness statements, and police accident reports. This evidence should be gathered as soon as possible following a <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/auto_acci\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/auto_acci\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Motor Vehicle Accidents in Colorado\">motor vehicle accident</a> and should be safely secured throughout the case.</p><p>Moreover, because Colorado adheres to the standard of modified comparative negligence, individuals should watch their words closely. It is never advisable to admit actions that may have contributed to an accident. Doing so can be considered an admission of fault and used against you in the pursuit of your accident claim. </p><p>Equally as important is how the evidence is presented to the court. The evidence should be presented in such a manner that it shows a clear timeline of the defendant's actions that led up to the accident. </p><p><a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Contact Sloat &amp; Nicholson, P.C.\" style=\"background-color: white;\">Contact Sloat &amp; Nicholson, P.C.</a> with your questions regarding comparative negligence in Colorado.

Because of low lighting in the parking lot, you're unable to see a large pothole. When you step directly into this large pothole, you twist your ankle and fall, resulting in a broken ankle and hurt back. Store owners are responsible for keeping their parking lots safe and well-lit! They may be liable for damages if it's found that they were negligent in maintaining the parking lot. </p><h3>On the Job</h3><p>If you slip and fall at work because short cuts that were being taken, inadequate guidelines were posted to keep the floor safe, or a dangerous situation was ignored by a person in charge, this could also lead to a slip and fall lawsuit.</p><p>If you've experienced one of the situations above, or you want to know if your situation can lead to a slip and fall lawsuit, <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\">contact Sloat Law</a> for more information.

Today, we will be talking about a few of these employer liability situations, and more importantly how to steer clear of them.</p><h3>Job-Related Accidents or Behavior</h3><p>A legal doctrine exists called <em>Respondeat Superior</em> (Latin for \"let the superior answer\"). In this doctrine, it's stated that an employer is legally responsible for its employees.</p><p>There is a hitch though: the employee in question who causes an accident, misbehaves, or has negative behavior must do so on the grounds of the workplace while carrying out a job for the business or acting on the employer's behalf. In other words, if an employee acted out and did so on their own volition or because of personal motives, the employer might not be held accountable for employer liability. Obviously, there is a lot of room for interpretation for this law, sometimes necessitating litigation to determine fault. </p><h3>Negligent Hiring as an Employer</h3><p>As an employer you can also get into hot water for not hiring properly, failing to do background checks, or hiring someone that is a potential danger to people around them.</p><p>This also means that if you hire someone who has a criminal background and they do something harmful while on the job, you can be held responsible for employer liability because you're responsible for prior knowledge of past behavior.</p><h3>Avoiding These Claims</h3><p>Are you facing legal suit as a result of employee actions?

Emergency transportation services will take you to the hospital if you need further care.</p><p>But, what about minor accidents? Should you still seek medical treatment if you're able to walk and move independently after your accident and there's no obvious injury?</p><h3>Always Get Medical Treatment</h3><p>In an accident, you might not even realize you're hurt or in pain right after the accident. One of the biggest reasons behind this is when you're in a flight or fight incident your body produces hormones called endorphins.</p><p>Endorphins plus adrenaline can make it seem like you aren't in pain or hurt because they mask the pain until your body and mind have had time to recover.</p><p>Car accident survivors often don't feel pain right away, but hours later may process the fact that they're experiencing extreme pain and even limited mobility. Even if you think you're okay right after an accident, it's important to seek medical care to address issues that may not be immediately evident. </p><h3>Continue Treatment Until You're Told to Stop</h3><p>After a car accident, your doctor will diagnose you and your injuries. This is also the time when medical care and treatment begins. Whether they suggest rest and relaxation, taking off work, taking certain medications, seeing a specialist, or anything else, it's important to closely follow the treatment plan of your physician.

    "header": "The 4 Most Common Reasons for a Truck Accident",
    "text": "<p>Whether you're watching the news or on the road, some of the most horrific accidents that happen are because of a truck accident - usually because of commercial trucks. These are the 4 most common reasons for a truck accident.</p><h3>Driver Is Fatigued</h3><p>Long-haul truck drivers drive for long distances - longer distances and longer lengths of time than we spend on the average road trip. Supply chain demands and shipment due dates demand adherence to a strict schedule, even with all of the variables presented by traffic.</p><p>Long hours on the job and in isolation may cause fatigue, loss of concentration, a decrease in coordination and more. Sometimes, in order to increase profit margins, these drivers get very little sleep. Although government entities like OSHA enforce specific rules about truck driving hours on the clock, it's easy to fudge these numbers in order to increase profit margins. When push comes to shove, this can lead to disastrous consequences. </p><h3>Drug and Alcohol Use</h3><p>Alcohol has always been an issue when it comes to driving, but certain states like Colorado that have passed laws that allow legalization of marijuana are beginning to see more accidents happening because of drugs. Many truck drivers out there that have caused a truck accident have been found guilty of using drugs and/or alcohol while they are driving. </p><p>A truck accident can also be caused by prescription drugs when they're used improperly. Prescription drug addiction is a rising problem in the United States, and even when properly used, many drugs should not be mixed with driving.</p><h3>Distracted Driving</h3><p>We've all seen some crazy things while on the road. We often treat our cars like our own little homes, freely eating, texting, entertaining ourselves, or doing our hair despite the fact that we should be concentrating on the road. Truckers can also be guilty of this problem, especially during long-haul trips when they're in the cab for 6 hours or more at a time. </p><h3>Speeding Over the Limit</h3><p>While cars have their own speed limit, commercial trucks also have to follow speed limits set for commercial trucks - especially when it comes to hills, bridges, and sharp turns. Unfortunately, some truck drivers do not follow these laws.</p><p>This is one of the most common reasons for a truck accident - and the deadliest. Consider the weight: A car weighs around 45,000 lbs. A commercial 18 wheeler truck, on the other hand, weighs 80,000 lbs. This means that stopping time, turning radius, and the ability to course correct are all greatly compromised, which easily leads to severe accidents. </p><p>If you've been involved in a truck accident and you are seeking compensation for your injuries, contact <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at 1-800-873-3202.

    "text": "<p>Slip and fall accidents are nothing new. They happen every single day to people just like you. However, some slip and fall accidents can be severe, and lead to sizeable medical bills and time suffering with disability. If the property owner was at fault for your slip and fall accident, you can get compensation for these expenses that will ensure safe conditions in the future and help you get back on your feet. One place where the risks of a slip and fall accident can be high is in a restaurant.</p><h3>Causes of Slip and Fall Accidents</h3><p>There are a number of causes for slip and fall accidents at a restaurant. While there are potential hazards, it's the responsibility of the staff, manager, and owner to make sure that these <a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.kaivac.com/a_666-Slip-and-Fall-Accidents-in-Restaurants-are-on-the-Rise\" href=\"https://www.kaivac.com/a_666-Slip-and-Fall-Accidents-in-Restaurants-are-on-the-Rise\" target=\"_blank\">risks are reduced</a> by being aware of what's going on in the restaurant. </p><p>Here are 3 examples of situations that seem innocent enough. However, all three can cause a slip and fall accident that may lead to severe injury.</p><h3>Slip and Fall Accidents Are Dangerous</h3><p>Slip and fall accidents often cause the severe damage because you are falling against a floor that is hard, such as a wood or tile floor. With the weight of your body and the actual impact of the fall, this can cause broken bones, sprains, herniated discs, traumatic brain injuries and more.</p><h3>What To Do Next</h3><p>If you had a slip and fall accident inside (or outside) or a restaurant and you were injured, you might be able to hold the restaurant liable and get compensation for your injuries. If you are unable to work or have to miss work, you can also be given compensation for lost wages, as well as pain and suffering from the accident.</p><p>If you fall, the best thing you can do is report it to the manager of the restaurant. Next, you should call an ambulance or go to a hospital. Not only can they check out your injuries, but it will be documented that you came in, got checked out, and your list of injuries will be listed in your file.</p><p>The next thing you should do is call a lawyer!

According to the World Health Organization somewhere <a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.asirt.org/safe-travel/road-safety-facts/\" href=\"https://www.asirt.org/safe-travel/road-safety-facts/\" target=\"_blank\">around 1.25 million people</a> will die every year because of traffic accidents. </p><p>Today, we will be talking about the most common causes of traffic accidents so you can have a heads up on different things to look out for to keep yourself and those around you safe. </p><h3>Going Over the Speed Limit</h3><p>One of the most common <a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://seriousaccidents.com/legal-advice/top-causes-of-car-accidents/\" href=\"https://seriousaccidents.com/legal-advice/top-causes-of-car-accidents/\" target=\"_blank\">causes of traffic accidents is speeding.</a> Speed limits are measures that not only reduce accidents, but can also reduce the damage and injury caused by traffic accidents. </p><p>On the other side of the coin, going too slow can also cause accidents. You should make sure that you always follow the posted speed limits, but also stay aware of other signs around you ie; bridges, icy roads, or construction areas also might have posted speed limit signs that are there to protect you and those around you. </p><h3>Drunk Driving</h3><p>Driving while intoxicated can affect your brain; how you think, your coordination, your sense of how fast you're going, and your ability to react properly. Drunk driving or even driving while on drugs can seriously create a dangerous situation for yourself and those around you. </p><h3>Inexperience</h3><p>Another one of the most causes of traffic accidents is simply inexperience behind the wheel. Younger people, ages 17 to 24, or those that recently got their license to drive, get into accidents for all sorts of reasons. This may include being nervous or anxious, texting while driving, or not paying attention to signs on the roadways. </p><h3>Weather Issues</h3><p>It doesn't matter if you've been driving for 2 months or 20 years, at some point or another you'll run into weather issues. You need to understand how each type of weather can affect your car and your driving experience while behind the wheel. </p><p>Ice for example, especially black ice, can come out of nowhere.

Concussions happen when the brain receives impact from sudden momentum or a change in movement.</p><p><strong>Contusion</strong>: Contusions, on the other hand, are essentially bruises on the brain. Bruises might not seem like a big deal, but there is a significant difference between getting a bruise on your arm and a bruise on your brain. Complications can arise and if it's serious enough, the contusion will need to be removed via a surgical process.</p><p><strong>Coup-Contrecoup</strong>: This is similar to the one above because it does entail a contusion. In this case, however, it includes 2 contusions, one on the side of the impact and on the opposing side.</p><p><strong>Diffuse Axonal</strong>: This type of injury can be caused by a strong rotation of the head or neck. Whiplash is a good example of a diffuse axonal. While some concussions can be considered a diffuse axonal, not all axonals are concussions.</p><p><strong>Penetration</strong>: Just as it sounds, this injury occurs when an object has penetrated through the head into the brain.</p><h3>Symptoms to Watch for</h3><p>If you were in a car accident you should be aware of the symptoms of a TBI when evaluating the damage to your person. Here are a few <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.traumaticbraininjury.com/symptoms-of-tbi/\" href=\"http://www.traumaticbraininjury.com/symptoms-of-tbi/\" target=\"_blank\">examples of symptoms</a> you might see after a car accident:</p><p>If you experience one or more of the symptoms above, it's time to visit a doctor and be evaluated.

    "text": "<p>You might not realize it, but preventing falls is just as important in the kitchen as it is in the dining room of a restaurant. In fact, slip and fall accidents are one of the most common reasons for food service injuries in commercial kitchens. The good news is that with certain safety measures, they can be prevented, saving you a lot of money and grief.</p><p>Chances are you're reading this because you are either a cook in a kitchen or a restaurant owner. As such, you want to protect your employees and guard yourself from liability in case of a workplace accident. </p><p>One of the easiest ways of preventing falls is to simply look at previous incidents and risk factors that may occur in your kitchen. Here are some common examples:</p><p>As an employer, you should have rules surrounding shoes that can and cannot be worn in the kitchen. Not only can specialized shoes keep accidents from happening such as knives falling and cutting into sneakers, but specialized shoes have proper grip to prevent slips. OSHA specifically states that slip resistant shoes with low heels should be the only shoes worn in a kitchen.</p><p>Kitchens aren't the only places your employees can get hurt. They can also be injured outside of the kitchen. For example, if you have an entryway and you allow customers to place their dripping umbrellas there, one of your employees, you, or even a customer could slip on the wet floor.</p><p>Bathrooms can also be troublesome spots. Make sure that when designing the bathroom you place towel dispensers next to sinks. This keeps people from having to walk across the space, dripping all the way, to reach the dispenser.  </p><p>All of these issues not only can result in accidents, but you could be fined by OSHA by not keeping a safe kitchen for your employees. You may also expose yourself to workers compensation cases and lawsuits for premises liability. </p><p>For a free consultation <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">contact Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at 1-800-873-3202.</p>"

When that's the case, a slip and fall lawsuit can help you protect your rights and get the compensation you deserve. </p><p>Here are some tips to help you better prepare for a slip and fall lawsuit, and assemble dependable evidence that will support your case. </p><p>The #1 most important step to your slip and fall lawsuit is to seek medical treatment. This works a few ways:</p><p>No matter where the fall happened--in a store, on a sidewalk, at someone's house or even at work--make sure you report the fall to a manager, your boss, the landlord, or someone of authority that is in connection with the property. Get the details of the incident in writing from the person in charge and have them give you a copy of the accident before you leave the premises.</p><p>Whether it's collecting information from eyewitnesses, taking pictures of the accident scene, or documenting who else was involved, all of these \"documents\" are important pieces of information if you decide to claim a slip and fall lawsuit. The closer to the time of the accident that they're recorded and saved, the more reliable they are as evidence. </p><p>If you were hurt and you want to consider a legal action, it's time to hire a lawyer. A lot of the slip and fall lawsuits that happen are difficult to prove, which is why you need an experienced and professional legal professional by your side to help you through it all.</p><p>If you're scared to hire a lawyer because you think it is going to cost something, you should also know that most lawyers offer a free consultation.</p><p>For a free consultation <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">contact Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at 1-800-873-3202.</p>"

A legal consultation is also the time to learn more about the lawyer, and determine whether you'll have a positive working relationship. </p><p>It's important to come prepared to your legal consultation so that you can ask the appropriate questions and go home with the information you need to make a wise choice. Here are some questions that can help: </p><p>The legal system is built on understanding precedents. An attorney that is familiar with your type of lawsuit will be able to identify any issues that might come up in your case and they should be able to prepare you for these issues. This is also a time to learn what kind of experience your attorney has with this kind of case. </p><p>An experienced lawyer will rarely be able to predict the exact outcome of your lawsuit during the legal consultation because each case is different. However, they will be able to talk to you about similar outcomes for similar cases they have represented through the years, as well as the strength of the evidence that you have. </p><p>When it comes time to end the legal consultation and leave the office you should have a clear understanding of the costs including fees and general expenses for the lawsuit. Many accident lawyers offer a contingency fee ie; you only pay a fee if they help you win your case. </p><p>That being said, it's important to understand possible extra expenses such as hard costs. Hard costs are expenses a lawyer will spend for you out of pocket which you can expect to pay back. </p><p>Just because you talk to one specific lawyer during your legal consultation doesn't mean this is the one you will be dealing with. Often one lawyer will take the case but another will actually be your lawyer. A lawyer that works in a large firm might use associates for the lawsuit. Before you leave, ask who you will be working with and if you can meet them.</p><p>For a free consultation <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">contact Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at 1-800-873-3202.</p>"

Whether you're driving through wintery mountain passes, or crawling through rush hour traffic in Denver or Boulder, a car accident is a risk no matter how good of a driver you are.

    "text": "<p>Few people see the benefit in filing an auto accident report with the police after an incident. It may simply seem like extra paperwork to deal with, when you have enough on your plate. Just as it's important to visit a hospital for treatment after an accident for documentation purposes, it's also important to file an auto accident report.</p><p>Here are three scenarios wherein an auto accident report is essential to guard your rights: </p><h3>Denial Denial Denial</h3><p>Let's say in this scenario that someone makes an illegal left-hand turn and hits into your car. You both pull over to the side and he says it was totally his fault. You decide to opt out of the police report only to find that his insurance calls and says that it was your fault. Unfortunately, you don't have any proof otherwise, and you might end up engaging in a pointless battle of \"he said, she said.\" </p><p>An auto accident report can keep this from happening, as you have documented evidence to back up what each person says to their insurance company. </p><h3>Excessive Damage Where There Was None</h3><p>In this scenario, the fender bender was your fault. But, the other person says not to worry about it, its no big deal. A while later you get a call from their insurance company that says that you caused excessive damage to their car. Eventually, you find yourself paying for fixes to their car that you're sure had nothing to do with the fender bender. </p><p>An auto accident report can protect you by specifying the extent of the damages caused specifically by the accident in question. </p><h3>A Lawsuit Is Filed</h3><p>Either situation above, and many many others, can lead to a lawsuit filed by either party. If that's the case, then an auto accident report is going to play a pivotal role in the lawsuit.</p><p>When a lawsuit is filed, documentation is absolutely necessary. Not only can it help you cover the costs of repairs and medical bills, but it can also provide compensation for time off, a new car, loss of income, etc.</p><p>If you are in any kind of an accident, its imperative that you call the police and get proper documentation.</p><p>Were you in a traffic accident?

One of the most common places a TBI happens is in a car; a sudden jolt caused by an accident, or by an impact to the head, leads to trauma which can be hard to detect, and hard to treat.</p><p>TBI's can also occur during a slip or fall incident, or in the workplace. Whether you were driving, lifting, or just walking when a TBI occurred on the job, what should you do next? </p><h3>Symptoms of Traumatic Brain Injury</h3><p>TBIs are one of those things that can vary from case to case and person to person. They can also range from minor to moderate and severe. Some common symptoms include:</p><p>In more complex and severe situations complications can include seizures, infections, vertigo, and even fluid buildup in the skull.</p><p>If you were in an accident at work and have one or more of these symptoms, it's time to call a Boulder law firm!</p><h3>What to Do After an Injury</h3><p>Before you call a Boulder law firm, first and foremost you need to seek medical care. This does two things. First, off they can take care of you better than anyone else and stop or slow down any complications. </p><p>Second off, when you enter into a hospital, they automatically create a file for you that says what happened, and what your injuries were.

The lawyer, if it comes down to it, will be able to get your diagnosis from the doctor and will be able to use that as proof of the accident.</p><p>After getting medical treatment for your injury, look into workers comp benefits and see if they are willing to pay for time off, your doctor bills, rehab, and other associated costs of your injury.</p><h3>Calling a Lawyer for Help with Compensation</h3><p>Although some workers compensation programs are helpful and accommodating, most of the time these encounters are frustrating to the worker, and they find that only a portion of their attendant bills are covered. Simply getting a consultation with a lawyer will help you to better understand what your rights are in this case so that you have the leverage to get the compensation you need to take care of yourself and your family. </p><p>If it was the fault of the workplace you can seek compensation for your medical bills, leave of absence (loss of income) rehab and more.

No matter how solid your case, you need to abide by a few important rules to make sure that you not only win the lawsuit, but that you get the right compensation. Here are some of the most common mistakes that we see in car accident lawsuits: </p><p>Many people believe that the more they can exaggerate the accident in question, the more compensation they'll receive. That's not the case. Exaggerating the case can compromise your testimony, which will be immediately exploited by the opposition. If you're caught in a lie, the case could be thrown out entirely.</p><p>Conversely, some personalities are prone to downplay the incident, and overestimate their own ability to \"handle it.\" Make sure that you accurately gauge the ramifications of what happened. </p><p>So many people these days have something happen in their lives (good <em>or</em> bad) and automatically post it on Facebook or Twitter. When dealing with a car accident lawsuit, do not post any information, stories, or pictures online. Insurance adjusters know that they can use this information against you, and anything posted on social media can be used as evidence. </p><p>Before you sign anything, you absolutely should have a car accident lawsuit lawyer beside you. They will be able to read over the documents and let you know what they mean in layman's terms and if they are safe to sign or not. Any statement, from the police report, to preliminary documents from an insurance company, could contain important information about liability. </p><p>Anytime you have any kind of an accident (from car accidents to slip and falls) you should be and are allowed to take pictures. The pictures should include not only the surroundings where the accident happened, but also the vehicles involved, and any possibly injuries on your person.</p><p>It's important that after a car accident you follow your doctor's orders and make sure you don't miss any appointments, including follow-up appointments and physical therapy. Failure to meet scheduled appointments could lead the opposition to undermine your claim of injuries. </p><p>Were you injured in a car accident?

It's important to understand that when it comes to defending your rights, the earlier you have experienced representation, the better. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;\">Essentially, this person is an advocate - someone in your corner who knows the law and is willing to fight for your rights. Below are a few specific instances wherein a personal liability attorney can help you. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;\">If you're involved in an accident, don't fool yourself into thinking there won't be a time when you need to speak to either your insurance company or the other party's insurance company.  </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;\">In fact, there will probably be numerous conversations you need to have. One of the best reasons for having a personal liability attorney is that they can speak on your behalf and ensure that your rights are protected.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;\">If you're unfamiliar with legal proceedings (as many are), you might not be aware that in certain situations, there is a statute of limitations. After a certain period of time, you can no longer make a claim that will be permissible in court. </span><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;\">A personal liability attorney, on the other hand, is aware of these limitations, and can get your case moving forward within the proper timeframe. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;\">One of the biggest reasons that individuals hire representation, especially for car accident cases, is because they'll be going up against experts. These opposing representatives of either the insurance company or the other person involved in the accident do this day in and day out, and they'll do everything they can to discredit your claim. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;\">The legal process is complex and specialized.

If they offer you an amount that you are simply not comfortable with, it's a good idea to hire a lawyer to help negotiate your auto accident settlement. </p><p><br></p><p>Even if you feel fine after an accident, you should always go to the doctor to secure documentation for all your injuries, any medication that was prescribed, and additional relevant information about your accident. This also helps you document changes to your condition in the weeks following the accident -- for example, a concussion graduating to more serious symptoms. </p><p>Documentation will also allow your lawyer to see how much you have been charged for medical bills, rehab, and prescriptions, which will make it easier to determine an appropriate auto accident settlement. </p><p><br></p><p>If you secure an auto accident settlement, the way in which it is paid can vary depending on the amount of money you receive. For large sums of settlement money, an insurance company can elect to pay you a set amount of money every year until the settlement is paid in full. </p><p><br></p><p>While you negotiate your auto accident settlement, you should be aware that the process is completed once the negotiation process is finalized and all paperwork is signed. Once that final step is taken, you cannot go back and re-negotiate your auto accident settlement, so do not sign any paperwork if you are not happy with the settlement amount. </p><p><br></p><p>For a free consultation, contact <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at 1-800-873-3202. </p><p><br></p>"

These losses fit into these seven different types of damages you may receive after a personal injury lawsuit: </p><p><br></p><p>The most common type of compensatory damages in a personal injury lawsuit are damages that cover the costs of medical treatment. This category includes not only hospital bills, but also bills from rehabilitation and additional care after the accident -- both now and in the future. </p><p><br></p><p>If your salary was impacted because of injuries suffered during an accident, you may receive damages to cover loss of earnings, as well as loss of earnings capacity in the future. </p><p><br></p><p>If any items were damaged or lost during the accident-- such jewelry, your vehicle, or personal technology devices -- you can request compensation for these items in a personal injury lawsuit. </p><p><br></p><p>One of the hardest to calculate personal injury lawsuit damages is pain and suffering. This category of damages provides compensation for physical pain and discomfort related to injuries caused by an accident. </p><p><br></p><p>Emotional distress damages are similar to pain and suffering damages, and a personal injury lawsuit may lump physical and emotional suffering together. However, emotional distress damages are usually considered a separate category. This covers costs related to anxiety, mood changes, depression, and other symptoms, as well as any therapy or medication required to manage these conditions. </p><p><br></p><p>If you enjoyed activities or hobbies before your accident that you can no longer participate in, you may be able to secure compensation for loss of enjoyment during your personal injury lawsuit. </p><p><br></p><p>One of the least common types of damages determined in a personal injury lawsuit is loss of consortium damages. These award compensation for changes in one's relationship with their legal spouse -- for example, an inability to maintain a sexual relationship or to provide for their care-taking needs. </p><p>In some states, loss of consortium damages can also be applied to relationships with children. If you can no longer care for your child in the same way you could before an accident, this can be considered a loss of consortium in those states. </p><p><br></p><p>For a free consultation, contact <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at 1-800-873-3202. </p><p><br></p>"

When a driver fails to pay attention to foot traffic, signs, or lights on the roadways, it can result in a pedestrian accident. These behaviors are some of the most common causes of pedestrian accidents:</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"><br></span></p><p>Distracted driving includes a wide range of behaviors, including talking on the phone, texting, changing the radio, applying makeup, eating, and socializing with passengers. Distracted driving lengthens the driver's time of response to changes in their surroundings -- including pedestrians in the area, even though those pedestrians often have the right of way. </p><p><br></p><p>Speeding is a traffic law violation in its own right, and it can even cross a line into reckless driving charges. Not only does speeding increase the likelihood of a driver causing a pedestrian accident, but it also increases the potential severity of the injuries the pedestrian may suffer due to the increased speed and force of the vehicle. </p><p><br></p><p>Like speeding, driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol is a traffic violation as well as a behavior that increases the risk of a pedestrian accident. Intoxicated driving not only slows a driver's reaction times but also impairs their overall motor function. </p><p><br></p><p>Responsible drivers will adjust their driving behaviors for fog, snow, rain, and other storms, but others fail to take their climate surroundings into account. When changing weather makes driving conditions more challenging, the risk of a pedestrian accident rises. In particular, weather conditions can impact visibility with fog or rain, or limit a driver's ability to slow or stop due to icy or wet roads. </p><p><br></p><p>Left-hand turns are unavoidable, but they still pose a significant risk of a pedestrian accident, especially when pedestrians are crossing the street. Typically these accidents occur when a driver focuses too intensely on automobile traffic in an intersection and fails to attend to pedestrians in the crosswalk. </p><p><br></p><p>For a free consultation or to learn more about pedestrian accident settlements, <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">contact Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at 1-800-873-3202.</p>"

    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Being involved in a slip and fall accident can be a scary situation, and you may have a lot of questions about the process of pursuing a settlement -- but it can be difficult to find answers. Here are answers to some of the most common questions personal injury attorneys are asked about slip and fall settlements:</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"><br></span></p><p>Anyone who is injured on another person's property may be able to pursue slip and fall settlements by filing lawsuits against the owner of the property. Property owners are legally required to maintain a safe environment for visitors. This includes businesses such as grocery stores, restaurants, and gyms, as well as residential properties like single-family homes and apartments. If you are injured at one of these sites as a result of owner negligence, slip and fall settlements can help you secure compensation for medical bills, lost wages, and pain and suffering damages. </p><p><br></p><p>In pursuing slip and fall settlements, the first order of business is determining liability. Your legal team will investigate questions that will determine if you have a viable case against the property order, including whether you could have avoided the accident or were unnecessarily careless, whether the owner was in any way negligent, and whether the owner's negligence directly contributed to your injuries. </p><p><br></p><p>Every case is different, but in general, slip and fall settlements are not the largest settlements secured for personal injury cases. Part of this is that the injuries sustained are typically minor and temporary, such as sprains, pulled muscles, or minor breaks. Medical expenses for these injuries are fairly minor, so compensation will be adjusted accordingly. Severe, lifelong injuries with long-term expenses, such as head injuries, severe breaks, or torn ligaments, can warrant higher slip and fall settlements. Working with an experienced personal injury lawyer can help you ensure slip and fall settlements secure compensation that suits the circumstances. </p><p><br></p><p>For a free consultation, <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">contact Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at 1-800-873-3202.</p>"

    "header": "How is Pain and Suffering Calculated?",
    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Pain and suffering compensation can be challenging to calculate, especially in the stressful period after an accident. While there are a wealth of online calculators that will estimate compensation for pain and suffering, you can find the most accurate determination if you contact a lawyer to talk about your case. A lawyer will listen to your account, explain what factors will be considered to determine your pain and suffering, and give you a better idea of what compensation you might expect.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"><br></span></p><h3>Definition Of Pain &amp; Suffering</h3><p>An accident settlement includes pain and suffering damages, as well as economic factors such as medical costs, rehabilitation bills, and lost wages from not being able to work. These economic damages come with extensive documentation that makes their costs easy to calculate, but pain and suffering is harder to estimate. It includes any situation, pain, or emotional distress you went through as a result of an accident. </p><p><br></p><h3>Insurance Companies</h3><p>In cases where a person is injured in an accident in which the other party is clearly at fault, the injured party will receive compensation for pain and suffering. However, the amount of compensation initially offered through an insurance company is generally very low.</p><p>Working with a personal injury attorney can help you get a fairer offer from your insurance company. Not only will a personal injury attorney help increase your insurance compensation, but they know all the ins and outs of the legal system, how to contact and communicate with insurance companies, and how to represent you in court if necessary.</p><p><br></p><h3>What Factors Are Considered?</h3><p>When an insurance company is looking at what/how to compensate you for pain and suffering there are a few different factors they will be looking at. These factors include: the type and severity of your injuries; how your injuries have impacted your life, relationships, and work; the amount of medical treatment you will need; how long your healing process will be; and whether you'll need future care such as home car, therapy, surgeries, or medication. </p><p><br></p><p>For a Free Consultation contact <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at 1-800-873-3202.</p>"

    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Filing a car injury claim is an important step after a car accident. The car injury claim process is long and can get complicated, so it's important to know what to expect. In order to receive any compensation after an accident, you'll have to file your car injury claim properly.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"><br></span></p><h3>What To Do Right After A Car Accident</h3><p>The most important thing you need to do immediately after an accident is seek out medical attention. Medical care will insure that any injuries or pain you've sustained will be taken care of, whether through medication, surgery, or a cast.</p><p>Medical care will also ensure that you have a record of any injuries the accident may have caused. From the moment you enter the hospital until you leave, detailed records will be kept of what injuries you sustained and what was required to fix them. Having these records will be vital if you plan on filing a car injury claim. </p><p><br></p><h3>Were You Seriously Hurt?</h3><p>Some accident injuries are considered far more serious than others during the car injury claim process. You will be considered seriously hurt if you need to go to rehab, have a deformity, lose a limb, miss work, experience severe pain, or become bed-ridden as a result of your accident. </p><p>Even if your injuries are serious and obvious, it is still in your best interest to hire a lawyer before filing your car injury claim. A lawyer can guide you through all the steps of filing your claim properly, and they can also help you obtain important documents and evidence while reducing the stress of the claim process. </p><p><br></p><h3>Some Injuries Are Worth More Than Others</h3><p>Car injury claims can be filed for a wide range of injuries, and every injury is worth a particular amount of compensation. For example, a spinal cord injury will most likely allow you to receive the maximum compensation. On the other hand, soft tissue injuries such as sprains have a lower compensation amount. A qualified personal injury lawyer will help you through the claim process so that you can receive the compensation you deserve.</p><p><br></p><p>For a Free Consultation contact <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at 1-800-873-3202.</p>"

    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Most drivers already know what to do if they are in a car accident. But what happens if you were involved as a passenger? Being in a car accident can be very scary and overwhelming, especially if you've experienced passenger injuries, and it can be hard to know what you have to do. Below, you will find a guide to 3 different options for filing a claim for passenger injuries:</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"><br></span></p><h3>File A Claim With The Other Driver's Insurer</h3><p>If you were in a car and you have passenger injuries, your first option is to make a claim against the other driver's insurance policy. In most states, drivers are required to carry a certain amount of insurance with them while they are driving.</p><p>Some potential issues can occur with this type of claim for passenger injuries. First, the other driver might not be able to cover your expenses. Even if they can, the process of dealing with another driver's insurance can be a pain. Fault is not always obvious, and it can take a lengthy and messy process to sort things out.</p><p>If you decide to take this route, hiring a personal injury attorney can help make the process smoother and less stressful.</p><p><br></p><h3>Filing A Claim Through Your Friend's Insurance Policy</h3><p>If you were in your friend's car when the accident occurred, you can also recover compensation for your passenger injuries via your friend's policy.</p><p>The compensation should be clear-cut, and you should get reimbursed quickly in order to pay your injury-related bills sooner. If you are uncomfortable with filing a claim through your friend's policy, you can also start with the first option above and then use your friend's policy to cover any leftover expenses.</p><p><br></p><h3>Filing A Claim Through Your Insurance Policy</h3><p>If you don't drive and don't have car insurance, this option won't work for you, but if you do have car insurance, you can file a claim for your passenger injuries through your own policy.</p><p>Being involved in an accident and becoming injured is not something anyone plans for. If you want help through this confusing process, you should seek out a personal injury lawyer for your passenger injuries. </p><p><br></p><p>For a Free Consultation <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">contact Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at 1-800-873-3202.</p>"

    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Having the right personal liability lawyer can make a huge difference n the outcome of your<a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/faqs\" target=\"_blank\">claim</a>, which is why its important to choose the right lawyer for the case. These are a few things you need to know before you hire a personal liability lawyer.</span></p><h3>Experience Does Matter</h3><p>One of the biggest reasons people don't hire a lawyer is because they don't realize they can actually go in and get a consultation for free. Make sure if you find a <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/attorneys-staff\" target=\"_blank\">lawyer</a> who is licensed to practice in your area and has a record of experience in personal injury liability, call them and ask them about a free consultation.</p><p>Not only is it important to find a personal liability lawyer who is well educated in his practice, but who actually has experience in your particular kind of case.</p><h3>Filing A Lawsuit Isn't Always Needed</h3><p> In some situations, a case won't need to go to trial and a lawsuit might not even be needed. Instead, the personal liability lawyer can get vital evidence and information about the case and take it to the insurance company for compensation. </p><h3>Be Aware Of The Fee</h3><p>While consultations are usually free, a personal liability lawyer has to be paid for his time. Almost all lawyers will work on a contingency-based fee. This means they pay expenses out of pocket and they are paid by a percentage of the amount when the case wins. </p><h3>Extra Expenses Are Not Included</h3><p>While the fee for the lawyer can be paid out of your settlement for the lawyer, there may be \"other\" fees you will need to pay out of the settlement. For example, if the lawyer pays out of his or her pocket to hire an investigator, you'll need to pay them back for this favor. The investigator will be beneficial to your case, but it's not a free service by any means.</p><h3>A Case Takes Time</h3><p>If your case goes to trial, be realistic. This will take time. Not only does communication between your lawyer and the defendant's lawyer take time, but your lawyer will need time to collect pertinent documents and evidence. Before you hire a personal liability lawyer make sure you ask them how long they really think it will take.</p><p>For a Free Consultation <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">contact Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at 1-800-873-3202.</p>"

Each of them offers different specializations and have different ratings? But, what about location? Does it matter if you choose a lawyer who is located outside of your area? How about another state? Why is it important to hire a lawyer who practices law in your city.</span></p><h3>Learn About Their Reputation</h3><p>If you live where the local law firm is, you can ask friends, neighbors, or family about the firm and get a straight answer, face to face. If a law firm is in a specific city, you can bet that the locals will have something to say about them - have it be something good or something bad. When you need to hire a good attorney that has a proven track record, there are no better testimonials, than from the locals.</p><h3>Convenience Of The Visit</h3><p>If you hire a local law firm that is in another city or state, you won't be able to meet up with them when the situation calls for it. </p><p>Plus, if you need to deal with paperwork, notarization, or to even discuss strategies with the legal team or paralegal, you can do it right away, set up last minute meetings and you can do it all while within a short distance of the firm.</p><p>Lastly, a law firm will not pay for your out of pocket expenses when traveling. This will include gas, hotels, wear and tear on your car, airplane tickets, etc. </p><h3>Established Relationships</h3><p>Not only will a local law firm have established relationships with judges in the locale, but also other attorneys. Plus, if you get a local firm you may be able to find a <em><strong><a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/attorneys-staff\" target=\"_blank\">lawyer</a> </strong></em>who is more likely to help get the case settled without going to trial. </p><h3>Experienced With Local Law </h3><p>If you work with a local firm you can rest assured that they will have extensive experience in working with local laws, procedures, and policies.</p><p>If you need a local law firm or you want a <em><strong><a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">free consultation</a> </strong></em>about your potential case, <strong><em><a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> </em></strong>has a law firm in Boulder, CO.

    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\" rel=\"background-color: transparent;\">If something has happened in your life where you think your civil rights as a human have been infringed upon, it might be a good time to seek out a civil attorney. Here are a few benefits or things to look out for when hiring one.</span>  </p><h3>They Can Offer An Evaluation</h3><p>A civil attorney can offer insight into your situation and tell you if you really are being discriminated against. These aren't just work discriminations either. They can involve University and Housing situations, renting a car, or just about anything else. Discrimination revolves around sexual orientation, race, religion, gender, and country of origin.  </p><p>They also include unwarranted search and seizures, cruel and unusual punishment, abuse by an official, or any number of situations.  </p><p><br>  </p><h3>Talk To Your Friends And Family</h3><p>Most people have never hired a lawyer and don't even know how to start the path to finding one. The best place you can start is with asking your friends and family for advice. Ask around, to find out if they have ever hired a civil attorney or if they know of someone else who has. Who did they hire? How did the civil attorney help them? What is their contact information? Did they win?  </p><p><strong><br></strong>  </p><h3>Do It Now, Not Later    </h3><p>When it comes to lawsuits and a violation of civil rights, there ARE statutes of limitations. This means you only have a short window of time to talk to someone and get your claim going before its too late. Once the limitations have passed, you can't hire a civil attorney for the issue and you can't file a claim or sue.  </p><p><strong><br></strong>  </p><h3>Free Consultations  </h3><p>These days, just about every single type of lawyer, including a civil attorney, has a free consultation option. This lets discuss your situation, ask questions, ask the civil attorney about their input and more. Free consultations really are free.  </p><p>Be prepared for your consultation and make the most of it. Write down a list of questions to ask, examples of where you felt you were being discriminated against if you had witnesses to these situations, and what your goals are for the claim.  </p><p><br>  </p><h3>Ask About Experience  </h3><p>It is expected for you to ask the civil attorney for details and <i><a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/testimonials\" target=\"_blank\">testimonials</a></i> of their track record. You should be looking for an attorney who can really help you win your case and achieve your goals.  </p><p>For a <i><a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/faqs\" target=\"_blank\">Free Consultation</a></i> contact <i><a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a></i> at 1-800-873-3202.  </p>"

More often than not, these claims are actually dealt with outside of the courtroom and rarely need to fo to trial. While there are benefits to settling before the court, there are also benefits to going to court.</span>  </p><h3>Settling Before A Lawsuit</h3><p>Benefits:  </p><p>- You can receive compensation more quickly<br>- You can avoid hearings, trials, depositions<br>- You can avoid an unpredictable jury decision  </p><h3>Settlement Talk With A Demand Letter</h3><p>A demand letter is needed in an auto accident lawsuit if you want to do it outside of court.

The attorney will be able to make sure statements, documents, and photos of evidence will enable them to move forward with the auto accident lawsuit.  </p><h3>Going To Court</h3><p>If you don't want to or cannot settle out of court, you'll have to go to court. I'ts always better to try and settle your case out of court, but if that doesn't happen you will need to take specific steps for your auto accident lawsuit.  </p><p>- Your lawyer will file the auto accident lawsuit in court and draft a formal document and legal complaint. They would then submit this to the appropriate court.  </p><p>- You will need to participate in the discovery process. Your lawyer will request information from the defendant and their lawyer will also request information from you.  </p><p>- Lastly, you will go to trial.  </p><p>If at any time during the court case you change your mind and decide to settle out of court, you can. Your <i><a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/attorneys-staff\" target=\"_blank\">attorney</a> </i> would simply look over the offer again and you would receive an acceptable offer for the auto accident lawsuit.  </p><p>Hiring a lawyer is for your benefit.

Sometimes the damage is nothing more than a few scrapes that are easy to walk away from. In other instances though, injuries can be extremely serious or even fatal. When a family loses a loved one due to wrongful death in the workplace their lives can be turned upside down. This is especially true if the person who died was the breadwinner of the family.

It becomes more difficult when the death is caused by the wrongful actions of another person.  </p><p>If you live in Colorado and plan on filing a wrongful death lawsuit, you should be aware of the wrongful death statute of limitations. These limitations are a period of time in which you can bring forth legal action against a person or company.  </p><p>As of 2018, the wrongful death statute of limitations is set at 2 years for Colorado.

    "header": "Teen Drivers And Colorado Car Accident Facts",
    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\" rel=\"background-color: transparent;\">Teenagers, more than any other age bracket, face the highest risk of endangering themselves and others. These teens are usually brand new drivers between the age of 16 years old and 19 years old.</span>  </p><h3>Inexperience With Driving</h3><p>One of the biggest reasons a teenager would be involved in a Colorado car <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/auto_acci\" target=\"_blank\"><em>accidents</em></a> simply because of the inexperience of the driver. While speeding is also another big reason, so are things like tailgating, and other distractions. In fact, texting and driving is one of the more common reasons for accidents.  </p><h3>Texting And Driving</h3><p>According to the American Automobile Association, 50% of all teens admit to texting while driving. While texting might not seem like a big deal, it is. There are 3 main types of distractions while driving. They include:  </p><p>- Visual - Taking your eyes off of the road. Whether this is because of looking down at a phone, trying to get something from under the passenger seat, or even getting something out of your purse, visual distractions are very common.  </p><p>- Manual - A manual distraction happens when you, as the driver, take your hands off of the wheel. It only takes a second for you to lose control.  </p><p>- Cognitive - Forgetting what you're doing.  </p><p>Texting while driving is so dangerous, that it actually falls into all of the categories above. Many states have actually banned talking or texting while driving. The only way you're allowed to talk or text is via voice control.  </p><h3>Stronger Restrictions</h3><p>Beyond just banning talking or texting while driving to reduce a Colorado car accident, states like Colorado have also introduced a 3 stage licensing system.  </p><p>The 3 stages include: A learners permit which allows a beginning driver to drive only if someone else in the car has a license. A learners permit which allows the new driver to drive alone but only under certain circumstances ie; they are not allowed to drive after the sun has gone down. Then, a full-fledged drivers license which allows them to drive on their own.  </p><p>States that have implemented the 3 stage restriction program have seen their crash rates reduced from 10-30%. The states include:  </p><p>California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.  </p><h3>Learning To Drive And Follow The Laws</h3><p>While it's great to teach your kids to drive - it allows for independence and it teaches them responsibility, it's also important as a parent to make sure your kids understand the laws and all those \"what if\" situations should they arise. One of the better ways to teach your kids all of these laws and get little tidbits of information is to allow them to take a driving class.  </p><p>These programs last anywhere from a week to several months. Not only are they helpful in teaching your kids how to drive, but it gives a nervous youngster more confidence.  </p><p>Driving schools do cost money, and they all cost different amounts - some might give your child a discount if they are in school, while others charge for weekly or monthly programs. Some of the best driving schools in Colorado for teen drivers are:  </p><p><strong>Master Drive (Denver, Colorado Springs, Fort Collins, Loveland)</strong>  </p><p><strong>Drive Safe Colorado (Denver-Metro)</strong>  </p><p><strong>Boulder Driving Academy (Boulder)</strong>  </p><p><strong>Excel in Driving (Denver-Metro)</strong>  </p><p>It is important to avoid being part of a Colorado car accident. This is why it is not only is it important that your kids drive safely for their own benefit, but also for other drivers on the road as well.  </p><p>In the event someone in your family is involved in a Colorado car accident, contact <em><a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a></em> at 1-800-873-3202 for a <em><a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/faqs\" target=\"_blank\">Free Consultation</a></em>.  </p>"

It is a checklist of quick tips to follow after a car accident. Since the mind goes into a panic after an accident, this allows you to think through the immediate steps ahead of time. It also allows you to fill out crash information with the details of what happened during the accident, information on the other vehicles/drivers involved, and more.</span></p><p>Here are a few things to remember and why it's a good idea to use a crash information form in case of an accident.</p><h3>Quick Tips After An Accident</h3><h3>The Accident</h3><p> Make sure you include the date, time and location of the crash. If possible, include street names or buildings near where the crash happened.</p><p>You should also be sure to include weather and road conditions. This will help your <em><a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/faqs\" target=\"_blank\">lawyer</a> </em>understand what conditions you were driving under and if there were any objects in the road that shouldn't have been.</p><p>This part of the crash information form also includes a section regarding the police officer (if any) who showed up to the scene.Be sure to get their name, badge #, the precinct they work for, the report #. It also includes crash information form on anyone else involved in the crash. This includes vehicle information for the other driver, witnesses, etc.</p><h3>Describe The Accident In Detail</h3><p>When you're in a <em><a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/auto_acci\" target=\"_blank\">car accident</a> </em>you might remember everything right then and there, but as time goes on or if you had a head trauma this could lead to you forgetting things - especially the small details. This is why filling out the What Happened section of the crash information form right then and there is of the utmost importance. </p><h3>Sketch The Accident</h3><p>There will also be a space at the very bottom of the crash information form. where you can sketch the accident with the information provided above. Show both your vehicle and the vehicles involved in the crash. Include arrows so you can indicate where the flow of traffic was going and the number the vehicles on the sketch so you can identify and help others (like your lawyer) identify which car was yours vs everyone else's. Even if you can only draw stick figures or boxes - that's okay, just try to fill out the sketch area as much as possible, to your knowledge. If you also run out of space here, you can use the back of the form.</p><p>If you've been involved in a car accident, the crash information form would then be given to your lawyer, along with any other information you have that was gathered from the above data, such as pictures of the accident.</p><p>If you've been involved in an accident in Colorado, <em><a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact Sloat Law</a> </em>at 303-447-1144 or 800-873-3202.</p>"

Maybe you're thinking it's just as easy to talk to the the insurance company and file the accident claim on your own. This is often not in your best interest. Lawyers know the ins and outs of the law, and they know how to get you the maximum amount of compensation possible for your accident claim. Not only that, but lawyers know all the little steps you should be taking along the way such as:</span>  </p><p>Lawyers provide years of experience to ease your burden after a car accident.  </p><p>When you <em><a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/faqs\" target=\"_blank\">hire a lawyer</a> </em>for an accident claim they will open up a line of communication to the insurance adjuster - the person who will essentially be deciding what the accident is worth and how much they are willing to pay out.  </p><p>A lawyer will also help you get all of the evidence you need to prove there was a liability for your accident claim. You probably already have evidence such as photographs, but your lawyer might even want to go back to the scene himself to see what the scene looks like, talk to officers involved, etc.  </p><p>Beyond just evidence of the accident itself, your lawyer will also get evidence of damage done to you or your car. That means if you went to the emergency room after the accident, the lawyer will get ALL the records, including admission records, what the doctor jotted down for injuries, what medications, therapy or prescriptions you would need, if future surgery is necessary - and the lawyer would also get the estimate of how much all of this would cost. These are all instances of evidence of injuries.  </p><p>On the other hand, if you were not hurt but your car was damaged, the lawyer will also possibly take pictures of the car and you might be asked to take it to an auto shop to get an estimate of the damages done to the car. These can be the piece of evidence needed for your accident claim. It also could be possible that while the lawyer obtains evidence for the claim, and body or car damage that your lawyer also might be able to see any negligence in the defendants claim.  </p><p>Once your lawyer has turned every rock and has gotten all the information and evidence they need, they will then negotiate your accident claim for compensation.  </p><p>You could, of course, do this on your own, but why would you want to? It's a stressful situation, not to mention that if you would handle it on your own you might not get as much of a settlement than if a lawyer handled it for you. A lawyer knows how to work different angles and get you the most amount of money possible for your accident claim.  </p><p>If you have been in a car accident in Colorado,<em><a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact Sloat Law</a> </em>at 303-447-1144 or 800-873-3202.  </p>"

    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">When you've been involved in a <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/slip\" target=\"_blank\">slip and fall</a> accident, there are certain steps you should be taking right away. If you fail to take the following steps, slip and fall accidents can be the most difficult accidents to prove.</span></p><h3>Get Medical Care ASAP</h3><p>Immediately following your slip and fall accident, it's important to receive medical care. This is important, because you want to receive immediate care following a slip and fall in order to receive treatment for any serious injuries. This also gives solid evidence of your injuries in case of a personal injury lawsuit. </p><h3>Report Your Slip and Fall To A Property Owner</h3><p>Whether your accident was on public property or at a private residence, it's absolutely important to contact the property owner or even a manager and let them know you fell on their property.</p><p>When a jury/judge looks at a slip and fall accident, one of the first things they consider is when the slip and fall accident was reported. </p><h3>Limit Communication To Property Owners</h3><p>While it is important that you make a formal report to a property owner it's not important to get into a deep detailed discussion of what happened.</p><h3>Take Lots Of Photos!</h3><p>Not only should you take photos of where the accident happened, but you should also take your own personal pictures of the injuries while you're in medical care.</p><p>Taking photos of the location is often something a slip and fall victim will not do. By not having the photos of the area you do yourself a disservice for a few reasons.</p><p>1- Pictures of the actual location, especially if it shows visible signs for why the accident happened, is important. This can include a cracked sidewalk, a missing step, improper lighting, a missing or shoddy rail, etc. </p><p>2- A lawyer may decide not to evaluate a case if there are no pictures of the location. </p><p>3- Unfortunately, when a property owner knows you've been hurt in a specific place on their property, they could go out and fix the location where the incident happened. This could make it seem like the slip and fall accident was not their fault, but yours, which could result in your claim not getting processed or not getting compensation for the accident.</p><p>If you've been involved in a slip and fall accident and you would like a <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">Free Consultation</a>, contact <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/attorneys-staff\" target=\"_blank\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at 1-800-873-3202.</p>"

    "header": "How To Handle A Colorado Motorcycle Accident",
    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">No matter how careful you are, when you drive a motorcycle you still have a chance of getting into an accident. Because of the sheer speed of a <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/motor\" target=\"_blank\">motorcycle</a> and because you don't have the enclosed the protection that a car enables, a Colorado motorcycle accident can be expensive, frustrating, and can lead to obvious injuries, disabilities, and even death. How you handle yourself after a Colorado motorcycle accident will significantly influence how the event will impact you in the near future.</span></p><h3>Get Yourself To Safety</h3><p>First and foremost you'll want to remove yourself from harm's way and get out of traffic and off of the road. You should distance yourself from the accident especially if your bike is on fire, leaking gas, etc.</p><p>You should also be checking yourself and others involved for injuries. Call 911 as soon as the accident happens and make sure everyone is all right. </p><h3>Remain Calm</h3><p>When you're involved in an accident it's easy to panic and freak out. This is an an especially important time to remain calm and make sure not to say anything that could indicate culpability from the accident. Don't argue with other people from the accident, blame people, or become physically violent.</p><h3>Don't Leave The Scene</h3><p>Whether you hit someone else or you were the only one injured, leaving the scene is the worst possible decision you can make. Remain at the scene to exchange information with the police and anyone else involved in the ccident. You should also get the following details:</p><p>- Property Damage Information<br>- Insurance Information<br>- Identify Vehicles Involved<br>- Gather Witnesses<br>- Take Photographs Of The Accident</p><p>Taking photos is a really important step. By taking photos you can prove that the motorcycle accident was not your fault. These pictures will be valuable pieces of information not only for law enforcement, but also for your lawyer. </p><p>If you seek legal aid in a Colorado motorcycle accident you will need photographs not only of the scene but also any of your injuries. Even using a simple cell phone is a good way to capture the scene, but make sure you get all of the pertinent details now.</p><p>If you've been involved in a Colorado motorcycle accident and you would like a <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/faqs\" target=\"_blank\">free consultation</a> contact <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson </a>at 1-800-873-3202.</p>"

    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">A legal consultation usually runs for around 30 minutes. This gives you time to get to know the lawyer, but it also gives the<strong><em> </em><a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/faqs\" target=\"_blank\"><em>lawyer</em></a> </strong>a chance to know you, more about your case, and if they can get you compensation for your case. Before you meet with a lawyer for a legal consultation you should consider the steps below.</span></p><h3>Bring All Of Your Documents</h3><p>Before going in for a legal consultation, make sure you gather up, organize, and bring all of the documents that involve your case. Be sure to make copies for your lawyer and keep the originals. </p><h3>Write Notes</h3><p>Not only should you be making a list of questions to ask before the legal consultation, but when you visit the lawyer you should also bring a notepad/notebook and a pen to write down any notes or to remember certain details that the lawyer gives you.</p><h3>Be Honest About The Case</h3><p>One of the most important things to remember about a legal consultation is that this is the time for you to be brutally honest with the lawyer. Don't hold back the facts and be 100% honest with the lawyer about your legal problems. Even if you have not hired the lawyer yet, you still receive the same privacy rights as any paying client would. Because of this, you can talk to them about anything and they have to keep it private.</p><h3>Talk About Fees</h3><p>This should go without saying, but money tends to be an uncomfortable topic so many people would rather just push it to the side. Before hiring a lawyer you need to ask about fees. Most lawyers have a plan put in place which only requires you to pay fees if they helped you to win the case. But, not every lawyer works like this, so bring it up in the legal consultation! If you cannot afford a lawyer right away, some lawyers will pay out of pocket expenses and then you would be required to pay them back when they help you win your case!</p><h3>Ask Questions</h3><p> Ask any questions. These questions can pertain to:</p><p>- The lawyers experience in cases like yours<br>- The lawyer's education and background<br>- Underlying fees<br>- Who will be handling your case</p><p>For a <strong><em><a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">Free Consultation</a> </em></strong>contact <em><strong><a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> </strong></em>at 1-800-873-3202.</p>"

    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">If you aren't familiar with the term employer liability coverage, this is a short summary on how it works and how it benefits the employee in case of an accident.</span></p><h3>Employer Liability Coverage</h3><p> Just as auto gap insurance is a separate policy that is used to cover the difference between what a car insurance company will pay for and what is still owed on a loan for a car, employer liability coverage works in a similar way. It covers the gap in expenses between a companies profit and lawsuits that might happen due to employee activities.</p><h3>What Isn't/Is Covered By Employer Liability Coverage?</h3><p>Here are a few instances where this type of coverage will and will not benefit you, the employee.</p><h3>Loss Of Consortium</h3><p>If a worker gets hurt on the job and receives workman's compensation, they cannot turn around and file a lawsuit against a company. However, this doesn't mean that the employee's spouse cannot file a claim. If this happens, the employer liability coverage will cover the costs of the claim.</p><h3>Intentional Acts</h3><p>One would also like to think that an employee would not put themselves in danger or that a manager would not allow an employee to do something dangerous. But more often than not, it does happen. This is where employer liability coverage comes in handy. If someone does something directly that is dangerous or a manager directs an employee to do something dangerous and that person gets hurt, w<a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/medical-law\" target=\"_blank\">orkers compensation</a> will not come to their aid. Instead, the business would be held responsible for the injuries or death.</p><h3>3rd Party Countersuits</h3><p>If an employee who works at a company is injured by a piece of equipment, they can file for workman's compensation. However, if you also try to sue the company that manufactures the equipment, the manufacturer's lawyers will most likely try to countersue the company where the equipment was used, deeming improper maintenance. If the employer loses the countersuit, Employer liability coverage is what would be used to help the employee that got hurt.</p><h3>Make Sure That You Have Good Representation</h3><p>Whether you work for a business and they have workman's compensation or employer liability coverage, you need proper representation to help you get compensation to cover medical expenses and your hurt on the job. </p><p>For a <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">Free Consultation</a>or for more information about your rights contact <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at 1-800-873-3202.</p>"

    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\" rel=\"background-color: transparent;\">Public Transportation supposedly has the ability to lessen the occurrence of an <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/auto_acci\" target=\"_blank\"><em> <b>accident,</b></em></a><b> </b> as opposed to driving in a car. But, public transit <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">accidents</a> do still happen. Just turn on the news and you may hear about injuries due to accidents on trolley cars, subway doors closing on them, or even trains derailing. In fact, train accidents are one of the most notable and common types of injuries in the news these days, but many types of transportation accidents happen.</span>  </p><p>If you've been injured in a public transit accident you might be wondering if you can sue and who you are supposed to make a claim against.  </p><h3>Common Carrier Considerations</h3><p>When it comes to a cab, bus, subway, train or any other \"vehicle\" besides the car you drive ie; public transportation, the law considers these entities to be a common carrier. Because a common carrier is responsible for the safety of others, they are in turn held at a much higher standard of care.  </p><p>In a public transit accident, you would need to prove that the operator of that vehicle acted in a negligent way which caused the public transit accident. However, this is a difficult thing to prove, if other people were involved in the public transit accident and also got hurt, it would be easier to prove the operator was at fault.  </p><h3>Transit Authority Tort Liability</h3><p>In the same way that most other legal claims have a binding statute of limitations, so does a public transit accident. Most states in the United States have a Tort Claims Act which means you have a certain period of time to file a claim. If you do not, then you are essentially forfeiting your right to recover compensation for injuries in a public transit accident.  </p><p>You can also hire or find a lawyer who has a free consultation process. This would allow you to meet with the lawyer, tell them what happened, when it happened, how the accident happened, etc. They would then be able to better fill you in as to if you have a valid claim, how much money you might be able to get for your claim and other steps you will need to take in processing your claim.  </p><p>For a <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\"><em><b>Free Consultation</b></em></a> contact <em><b><a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a></b></em><b> </b> at 1-800-873-3202.  </p>"

Because of this, the FMCSA and the PHMSA have both published and enforce safety regulations regarding distracted driving, including both texting and talking on the phone.</p><p>Commercial motor vehicles of any kind are now prohibited from texting while driving. It doesn't matter if you are using short text, instant messaging someone, going to a website, or even emailing on your phone. None of this is allowed.

The commercial motor vehicle driver rules now restrict a driver from reaching for a phone at all. The only way you're allowed to use a mobile phone while driving is if it is hands-free which means:</p><p>- The mobile phone has to be nearby for you to use it.<br>- The driver cannot remove their seatbelt to find the phone<br>- The driver has to use an earpiece<br>- The driver has to use hands-free or one-touch features on the phone</p><p>We know just how dangerous it is to text and drive or make phone calls while behind the wheel.

Some of the most common reasons for a birth injury include:</p><p>Excessive Pulling: if a doctor pulls too hard or does so in a rough manner, this can lead to a birth injury which could result in a traumatic brain injury.</p><p>Abnormal Use Of Tools: If birthing tools or birthing assist tools are used, such as forceps or a vacuum extraction, and they are used improperly.</p><p>Difficulties During Labor: A difficult labor can also cause brain damage in a baby such as extended periods of pushing or contractions. This can happen if the baby's head is knocked against the mother's pelvis.</p><p><strong>Results Of A TBI In Infants</strong></p><h3>Short-Term Effects Of Birth Injury</h3><p>Acidosis - Acidic Blood<br>Ischemia - Decreased blood flow to the baby's brain<br>Hypotension - Low Blood Pressure</p><h3>Long-Term Effects of A Birth Injury</h3><p>Epilepsy<br>Intellectual and Learning Disabilities<br>*Psychological issues<br>Motor disorders<br>Visual impairments<br>Hearing impairments<br>Feeding problems, nutritional concerns, and oral health issues<br>Orthopedic issues<br>Respiratory conditions<br>Seizures</p><p>While all of these effects have scientific and medical proof, psychological issues specifically such as anger issues, aggressive personalities, panic attacks, and anxiety have been linked to birthing injuries for infants.</p><p>In the end, it depends on what type of a birth injury or TBI injury your baby has that will result in either short or long term issues, now or in the future.</p><p>The long-term effects of a <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/tbi\" target=\"_blank\">TBI injury</a> will require long-term specialized care.

While there are more than a dozen different reasons auto accidents happen, there are five highly prevalent causes of traffic accidents.</span></p><h3>Distracted Driving</h3><p>According to the American Automobile Association's Traffic Safety Division, 20-50% of ALL crashes that happen because of distracted driving. Over the past 5 years distracted driving in terms of texting has reached an all-time high, even though most states have laws against doing so. Distracted driving also includes:</p><p>- Driver Fatigue<br>- Not paying attention to the road<br>- Talking on the cell phone<br>- Rubbernecking<br>- Reading books or maps while in the driver's seat<br>- Talking with other people in the car<br>- Adjusting the radio or GPS</p><h3>Drunk Driving/Drugs</h3><p>It's unfortunate that in this day and age we still see many people getting into accidents because they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol or someone else was. </p><h3>Speeding</h3><p>Not only is speeding one of the causes of traffic accidents, but it also lowers the reaction time you have to avoid a car crash. In fact, speeding is just as bad as drunk driving because it impairs the way you drive and react or are able to react to a situation.</p><h3>Bad Weather</h3><p>Another one common cause of traffic accidents is bad weather. Heavy rain, fog, snow, ice and even high winds can make any driving situation scarier and that much more difficult to maneuver.</p><p>Whether you are driving down the street or across the country try to put the trip off until the weather gets better or use another form of transportation.</p><p>If you absolutely need to get from point A to point B do so carefully. If you find yourself in a scary situation get to rest-stop or pull off and take a break.</p><p>No matter how careful you are, a <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/auto_acci\" target=\"_blank\">car accident</a> is not 100% avoidable. Not only because of surprise situations that may arise, but also the fact that there are other people on the road who might not be as careful as you try to be.</p><p>If you need a free consultation or you would like to know more about your legal rights, contact <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at 1-800-873-3202.</p>"

Even if you drive only 5 or 10 mph over the posted speed limit, this can create a life or death situation which can result in a car accident.</p><h3>Follow The 3 Second Rule</h3><p>The 3-second rule enables you to gauge the distance between you and the car in front of you. One of the biggest reasons <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/auto_acci\" target=\"_blank\">accidents</a> happen is because people don't leave enough room to stop properly.</p><p>1- Make a mental note about an object on the side of the road.<br>2- When the car in front of you passes it, begin counting<br>3- If your car passes that same object in less than 3 seconds, you are too close to the car in front of you.</p><h3>Make Time To Be On Time!</h3><p>People speed for all sorts of reasons, but one of the most common reasons for speeding is that you have someplace to be and didn't leave yourself enough time to get there. It doesn't matter if you're picking up your kids, going to work, or you are going to an appointment. You should give yourself an extra 30 minutes to get where you need to be. This extra 30 minutes will also take care of any surprise situations that may happen. </p><h3>Think Realistically About The Speed Limit</h3><p>In some cases, people think if they speed they arrive at their destination more quickly. But, is that really true? For instance, if the speed limit is 60 and you need to drive 60 miles, it might take a little over an hour to get there safely and on time. On the other hand, if you're going 60 in an 80 it might only shave off a few minutes of your time. </p><p>Is a few minutes really worth your life or the life of someone else? <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/death\" target=\"_blank\">Probably not.</a></p><p>For a Free Consultation contact <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at 1-800-873-3202.</p>"

So what happens when this device turns deadly?</span></p><h3>Seatbelt Malfunction Because Of A Manufacture</h3><p>If you've been in a <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/auto_acci\" target=\"_blank\">car accident</a> and the seat belt did not work how it was supposed to or did not work at all, there are various factors and tests that can be done on the seatbelt.</p><p>For example: if a person gets into a car accident and the seatbelt is still intact and on the individual but they were hurt, the seatbelt may have loosened and allowed for the individual to impact against the door, window or windshield. As you know, seatbelts are supposed to lock up, but if there is a seatbelt malfunction the locking mechanism will not work which is what is essentially going to cause injury to the individual. If the person in the car accident had their seatbelt on but it was torn, this could also be caused by a seatbelt malfunction.</p><p>What should you do if a seatbelt malfunction led to injuries you suffered during an accident? There are lawyers with experience in this type of law who can help you get compensation for your injuries IF you can find a way to prove it was indeed a seatbelt malfunction and the car manufacturer should be held responsible for the accident.</p><p>Not only will the manufacturer of the car be held responsible, but the person or company who made the seatbelt, designed the seatbelt, or installed the seatbelt.</p><p>You can sue both a car manufacturer as well as the company that made the seatbelt for either compensatory damages or punitive damages.</p><p>Compensatory damages helps financially compensate you for pain and suffering, medical bills, and will reimburse you for other money that was taken from you because of the accident such as loss of wages. </p><p>Punitive damages allow you to sue the company(s) for wrongdoing.</p><p>For a <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">Free Consultation</a> or to learn more about a seatbelt malfunction accident that you have been involved in, contact <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/faqs\" target=\"_blank\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at 1-800-873-3202.</p>"

These incidents are not only frightening, but can cause the most damage both physically and emotionally. These accidents are also the worst types of accidents because the damages are irreparable and can cause injuries that will last a lifetime, resulting in a financial burden on you or your family due to medical expenses, rehabilitation, lost wages, and more.</p><p><br></p><h3>Should I Contact A Truck Accident Lawyer?</h3><p>When you've been involved in a truck accident it can be difficult to figure out if you should handle the case on your own via the insurance company or if you should call a truck accident lawyer. In order to figure out if you need a truck accident lawyer, go through the list below. if you answer yes to 1 or more of the questions, it may be time to call a lawyer to help:</p><p>- Did the truck accident cause you serious injury? Did that serious injury lead to hospitalization, therapy or surgery?</p><p>- Did the accident cause you permanent injuries such as disfigurement, burns, loss of limbs, or even paralysis?</p><p>- Did the truck accident involve other vehicles or other people?</p><p>- When the accident happened, did it happen in a construction zone or during construction hours?</p><p>- Are you having issues with the insurance company? Have they hired a legal team for their own defense?</p><p><br></p><h3>Steps To Take After A Trucking Accident</h3><p>While this is the most useful type of evidence, you aren't always able to immediately take pictures of the scene. However, if you are able to, you should! If you cannot or you are too injured to do so, hopefully, someone else will have enough tact to take pictures for your case.</p><p>If you've been injured you were probably already taken to the hospital. If not, you need to go immediately after an accident. This will ensure you don't have any major injuries such as broken bones, internal bleeding or a concussion, plus will be an important part of the medical evidence for legal reasons. </p><p><br></p><p>The hospital should be able to give you a list of all the medications, procedures and surgeries needed for treatment while you were at the hospital, as well as how much each one cost. Keep track of your medical prescriptions because if you do hire a lawyer, all of these itemized lists will aid in figuring out what compensation you should be owed for your accident.</p><p>You should keep tabs on any out-of-patient care you need. If you need to go to therapy make a note of this in your records and ask the hospital or the rehabilitation center to give you records about your rehab, why you need it, what types of rehab you are doing, etc.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><br></span></p><p>Keep all of the medical information records and bills in a folder and organized for when you need to access it in the future or when you need to give them to your lawyer.</p><p>Reaching a settlement in a trucking accident can be a long drawn-out situation.

    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Safe winter driving isn't only meant to keep you safe, but also meant to keep everyone else on the roadways safe as well. Below you will find tips for general driving, as well as long-distance winter driving.</span></p><p>Severe weather conditions can make anyone nervous on the road, but if you follow safety rules when dealing with dangerous weather you can lessen the chance of a car accident happening to you or to someone else on the road because of an error you made while driving.</p><p>- Avoid driving when you are tired. It doesn't matter if you are taking your kids to school, driving to work, or driving down the street to your local grocery store. When you drive when you are tired you have slower reflexes and your mind tends to work at a much slower rate. Before driving anywhere in the winter, make sure you are well-rested.</p><p>- Never warm up your car in an enclosed area. Many wintertime deaths are caused by accidental carbon monoxide inhalation. If you want to warm your car up, have the rear facing the opening of the door and leave the door open. To be even safer, drive your car out of the garage and then proceed to warm the car up.</p><p>- Make sure you have the right winter tires on and that they are properly installed and inflated. If you are unsure if you have the right tires on and that they are properly inflated, visit a local auto mechanic or tire service store and ask.</p><p>- Never use cruise control in winter driving. This includes driving on icy, wet, cold, or snowy roadways. You always need to be in control of your car in case of any sudden obstacles.</p><p>- Always wear your seatbelt. This seems obvious and yet so many people get into their car and don't put their seatbelt on. Seatbelts save lives.</p><p>- If your car dies while in a snowstorm - do not wander the roadways. Put your blinkers on or use road flares so others know there is a car that has stalled, and call AAA or a towing company immediately. You can also try calling Uber. They have a new service in snowy states now where they will come jump your car for you. Or if it's an emergency or dire situation, call the police.</p><p>- Take your cell phone with you and make sure you keep emergency items such as road flares, an extra blanket, orange traffic cones, gloves, hats, food and other items in your car. This will help you if your car does stall or if you have an accident and are stuck somewhere off of the road.</p><p>- Never drive a car that is not at peak performance. Make sure you visit an auto mechanic before you go on your trip in order to make sure that your car is running properly and that any parts that need to be replaced can be fixed or replaced.</p><p>In the event of a winter storm Stay Home. If you simply cannot avoid driving in winter weather and you do have an accident that was caused by someone else, contact Sloat &amp; Nicholson at 1-800-873-3202. You can also contact <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/attorneys-staff\" target=\"_blank\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> if you have <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/faqs\" target=\"_blank\">questions</a> about your legal rights or need a <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">free consultation</a>. </p>"

While some injuries are simple enough, others can cause a lasting effect on your life. For example, a spinal injury can cause paralysis and walk again, let alone live the life you did before. </span></p><p>If you've been injured in an accident that was caused by someone else and you have a spinal injury you know just how costly medical expenses can be. If you need help on documenting your injuries in order to make sure you get compensation, here are a few tips to consider.</p><p>Even if you are not able to take pictures right when the accident happened, you can take pictures of the damage. Make sure you take pictures of the damage to your car. Include both short and long distances, photographs of the location, your injuries, photographs of x-rays showing you have a spinal injury, as well as recent photos of yourself before the accident happened.</p><p>You can get medical reports of what happened to you, what injuries you had, and what medications, surgeries or rehabilitation were needed because of the spinal injury or any other injuries you sustained. It's also a good idea to keep a journal and include everything in it. </p><p>- How has the accident changed your life?</p><p>- What is the extent of your pain?</p><p>- How does your daily routine differ now from your past routine? Are there any things you once were able to do that you can no longer do because of your injury?</p><p>Even the smallest of details can become essential when writing in your daily journal.</p><p>-Correspondence With Medical Professionals</p><p>If you have had any correspondence such as emails or conversations that have been recorded with your doctor or surgeon, these should also be included in your evidence reports.</p><p>If you needed medication prescribed to you, needed to purchase special equipment such as a walker or crutches, or you have to eat special foods while or after being injured - all of these should be noted in your medical related receipts.</p><p>You can also hire a personal injury lawyer to help you figure out what your lost wages are. Whether it's a temporary situation or permanent because of your spinal injury, you can be compensated for all of the issues above, but you can also be compensated for lost wages if you are unable to work.</p><p>If you are too overwhelmed or stressed out about the idea of filing a claim let alone getting everything together for your claim, consider hiring a personal injury lawyer. </p><p>A personal injury lawyer understands the law and understands how personal injury claims work and exactly what you need in order to prove the other person should be held liable for your spinal injury. They will also help you get the compensation you truly deserve. This is definitely not something you should be doing on your own! If you want to get through the claims process quickly and have the best outcome for your situation, hiring a personal injury lawyer is the best way of going about this.</p><p>A personal injury lawyer can even help with some or all of the tips above when it comes to documentation of evidence. This way you can spend time getting better and healing, rather than negotiating with lawyers and insurance companies and stressing out about the next steps to take.</p><p>For a <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">Free Consultation</a> or if you have questions about your case contact <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at 1-800-873-3202.</p>"

    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">You rely on your auto mechanic to keep your safe, make sure the improper tests are done on the car, and rest assured that they will take care of your car. But.. what if they don’t? What if there was an improper check up done on the car? What if they used a faulty part? What if these factors caused you to have a car accident? If this happens, you need to be aware about auto accident law in your state.</span></p><p>A proper auto shop is responsible for keeping your car safe for you to drive and are responsible for following certain protocol with professional standards. A licensed mechanic is responsible for giving you proper inspections, informing you of recalls, and making sure they process the vehicle repairs correctly.</p><p>If you are worried about the auto accident law won't apply, because your auto mechanic a contractual agreement that he or they (the business) cannot be held liable for any vehicle damage or accidents – fret not. If a mechanic's negligence causes an accident and you were injured, the contractual agreement is not binding. It's a disclaimer. Plain and simple. </p><p>Negligent work is caused by a shop failing to properly repair your vehicle according to industry standards. Additionally, sub-standard repairs which can lead to vehicle damage and make a car unsafe to drive, can also be a liability. </p><p>If you truly believe you had an <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/auto_acci\" target=\"_blank\">accident</a> because your repair shop, auto shop, or mechanic was irresponsible, then just like all other personal injury cases, you will need to prove the negligence.</p><p>As an example, suppose that you went in for your check up on the car. The mechanic tells you that the brake pads need to be replaced. They take the old brake pads off and put a new set of brake pads on. However, they replacement brake pads were the wrong type or the wrong size for your specific car and the wheels. On your way home, you attempt to stop at the stoplight, but your brakes suddenly don’t work. Because you can't stop, you veer into the intersection and another car strikes you or you strike another car and end up breaking your arm from the force of the car hitting your side of the car.</p><p>In this specific example, the mechanic could be held liable for buying and installing the wrong brake pads. However, you would need proof that this was the case. In most situations this can be proven by way of documentation – a mechanic has order forms he fills out in order to get parts in, along with your name, your car, registration number, etc. You could also hire an auto mechanic specialist who deals with cases such as yours to have the documentation that X part should have been ordered as Y part or was installed improperly.</p><p>This is why it's important that you hire someone who has experience in auto accident law. A lawyer will not only help you figure out if you have a valid case or not, but they can help you get the evidence and documentation you need to help win your case and get compensation.

With more bikes being manufactured and new types of bikes being invented, more and more people are riding on the roadways more than ever before. Unfortunately, with more cyclists on the roadways, this means drivers need to be more aware of cyclists and riders need to practice safety.</span></p><p>Many states tout some pretty scary statistics for bicycle accidents. 63% of overall bike accidents result in a <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/death\" target=\"_blank\">fatality</a>, while over 65,000 cyclists in Colorado actually suffer from severe injuries, including concussions and other head traumas.</p><p>It's your choice whether or not to wear a helmet, but with these statistics, why wouldn’t you? Most bicycles weigh between 15 to 23lbs, while a car weighs in at 4,000+ pounds. Even if you get bumped by a car you could be in for a world of pain without a helmet. If you get run into, rather than just bumped, the results could be catastrophic. When you don't wear a helmet and other safety gear, the chances of physical damage to your body versus wearing one are much higher.</p><p>When you wear a helmet you are reducing your injury in terms of a head trauma, by a whopping 85%. That alone should be reason enough to wear one.</p><p>If you were in a bicycle accident and made sure you had a helmet or safety gear on and were still hurt by another vehicle, you will benefit from hiring a bicycle accident lawyer who can help you get compensation for your claim and find fault in the parties who were at fault.</p><p>If you were in a bike accident and did all of these things above and were still hurt by another vehicle, contact a bicycle accident lawyer such as <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> for a <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">free consultation</a>.</p>"

    "header": "Common Reasons For Car Accidents",
    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">If you take a look at car accident statistics by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration you can see that a new car accident happens at least every 10 seconds somewhere in the country. Most of the accidents that happen out of these are quite serous and result in long-term damage or even death. Some really scary car accident statistics include the fact that 42,000 people die in car accidents in the United States each year. But why do these accidents happen so often? Is there anyway we can keep them from happening?</span></p><p>Here are just a few reasons as to why Colorado car accident statistics are also up there. </p><p>Colorado is one of those states that has banned texting while driving – and yet many people still do it. Text messaging – or other types of distractions, are a huge reason for car accidents. This can also include \"activities\" in the car such as applying makeup or grooming while driving to work, changing the station on the radio, picking up your phone to make a call or just not paying attention to the road. It would be nice if you could rely on people to pay attention while driving, but unfortunately that’s simply not the case.</p><p>The Insurance Institute of Highway Safety has said that one of the reasons the Colorado car accident statistics are so crazy high is because of drivers not going the speed limit. Just because a police officer isn’t around, doesn’t mean you should drive like a race car driver! The The Insurance Institute of Highway Safety states that over 900 drivers die a month due to speeding.</p><p>Even with organizations like MADD increasing awareness about drunk driving, people are still doing it. MADD has said that over 300,000 incidents in the US happen because of drunk driving. It could be a simple ding or something more serious where you hurt yourself or someone else. These accidents could easily be avoided if less people were driving under the influence.</p><p>Also, according to the Highway Loss Data Institute's President Matt Moore, states where its now legal to use marijuana, are now having more car accidents.</p><p>Any type of a drug or drink that can impair your coordination, impair or slow your reaction time, can of course cause a car accident because the drug or alcoholic drink is impairing your brain and how quickly it reacts. A person that is not drinking can stop and react much quicker than a person that has had a glass of wine.</p><p>While these are the most common reasons for <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/auto_acci\" target=\"_blank\">car accidents</a> in our country, there are, of course other causes. If you’ve been involved in a car accident and have been minorly or majorly hurt and you need someone to represent your case - it's a very good idea to hire a lawyer for your claim. A lawyer will help you figure out what sort of evidence you need to get together and how to proceed further. If you’ve, for example, been majorly hurt in a car accident you might need to figure out a way pay for medical bills or even loss of earnings.</p><p>A lawyer like Sloat &amp; Nicholson can help you with your claim. If you would like more <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/faqs\" target=\"_blank\">information</a> on your legal rights, have questions about your claim, or you need someone in your corner to help you with your situation, don’t hesitate to contact <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at 1-800-873-3202.</p>"

    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">When a Colorado bicycle accident happens between a bicycle and an <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/auto_acci\" target=\"_blank\">automobile</a> it can result in serious injuries or even <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/death\" target=\"_blank\">death</a>. In some cases the cyclist is the one to blame, but the blame can also fall on the driver of the car for not taking extra care or precautions to ensure the cyclist's safety. After all, cyclists have much less protection on a bike than a person does in a car or a truck. Because of the lack of protection this can cause injuries ranging from broken bones, sprains, spinal injuries, and more. A Colorado bicycle accident is a form of negligence. When it comes time to figure out who caused the accident, this can become difficult.</span></p><p>Unfortunately, when it comes to bike accidents, children are the ones who are hurt the most. While drivers should always exercise the care and awareness of others, accidents do happen. Because children don’t understand how dangerous it can be to ride a bike, especially on roadways that are busy, they don’t realize how careful they need to be as much as an adult bike rider would. When a driver of a car is driving through an area where they know a lot of children will be riding their bikes such as by a school, a park or a residential neighborhood, the driver of the car should automatically exercise extra care in making sure they follow the speed limits and watch out for children on bikes.</p><p>In more cases than not, when a bicycle accident happens it's because of negligence or recklessness. But, this does not automatically mean that the driver was the one that caused the Colorado bicycle accident. In fact, if a cyclist sues a driver for negligence, you can rest assured that the court will also hear and see evidence from the the bicyclist to make sure they were not the one being dangerous, careless, or reckless. The cyclist could have even broken a law, such as not riding with lights or deflectors on their bike when it's dark out.</p><p>A driver may be found guilty if they were caught speeding, driving into the other lane, driving off the road into the bike lane, or failing to follow the laws of the road. Or just being reckless overall. A driver can also be found guilty if they were seen by a witness purposely intimidate or run the cyclist of the road. </p><p>If the cyclists is the one who caused the accident or they were the one who was being careless or reckless, they will not be able to sue or counter sue for compensation.</p><p>If you are a driver it's important to always follow the rules of the road when it comes to giving a cyclist enough room. If you are a cyclist, it's important to take extra care in being aware of your surroundings when stopping, turning, or changing lanes, there are not any cars around so you can do so safely.</p><p>Whether you were the driver or the cyclist, if a Colorado bicycle accident happened, you will need a lawyer to help you through the claim, as well as be your legal advocate if it goes to court.

    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">In many cases, employees are unaware of all the \"could be\" accidents that can happen at work - to themselves or their co-workers. One of the most important things to do -- especially in a dangerous line of work --is to educate yourself on how to be more safe in the workplace. If you would like to know about some of the most common injuries, listed below are just a few of the ones that happen more often than you would think.</span></p><h3>Overexertion or Excessive Straining</h3><p>Believe it or not, this is by far and wide the most common injury in the workplace. It ranges from back and neck issues to knee injuries to <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/sci\" target=\"_blank\">spinal</a> issues. These often happen when a person is lifting, carrying, or pulling weighty objects. While most of the injuries in this category are usually temporary, some may cause permanent injuries in which you would need a Boulder personal injury lawyer to help you with your workman’s compensation case.</p><h3>Slips and Falls</h3><p> Many businesses put safety rules, signs, and products (such as wet zone cones) in place to keep you and everyone else safe. But, if those rules are broken or you have a <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/slip\" target=\"_blank\">slip and fall</a> accident due to a wet surface or items that obstruct walkways, these can cause major injury. This is when you should consider hiring a Boulder personal injury lawyer to help get compensation for your injury.</p><h3>Reactionary Falls</h3><p>Falls of any kind can cause injury. But what if you try to catch yourself before you hit the floor? These are called reactionary falls. Perhaps when you slipped and began to fall, you put your arms or hands out to catch yourself and ended up hurt yourself worse than if you had made initial impact with the ground. These types of falls can end up in compensation.</p><h3>Injuries From Machinery or Equipment</h3><p>Chances are if you work in an office building you won't have to worry about these types of injuries. But, people who work in saw mills, warehouses, industrial zones, or on construction sites do! Any workplace has a chance of injury, but add machinery into the mix and this could seriously cause some major injury. If you’ve been hurt due to a piece of equipment or machinery you should hire a Boulder personal injury lawyer for compensation in terms of your medical bills and emotional injury, as well as loss of income if you cannot come back to work right away.</p><h3>Workplace Violence, It Can Happen To Anyone</h3><p>This may seem like an odd personal injury. But, did you know that workplace violence is yet another type of workplace injury? In fact, it happens more than you may think it does. Essentially the company you work for is supposed to keep you and everyone else safe from harassment (sexual, physical and otherwise), abuse and violence while on the job. If they are not doing enough to prevent these types of issues, you can and should seek compensation if you’ve been harassed, abused, or acquired injuries due to a violent episode from another worker.</p><p>When you file a claim for workman’s compensation you can either fill out and do the paperwork yourself or you can seek out help from a Boulder personal injury lawyer. If you would like more information, have questions, or you would like a free consultation, contact <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> at 1-800-873-3202.</p>"

    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\" rel=\"background-color: transparent;\">The aftermath of a hit and run accident can become a nightmare. Over the years, the probability of a hit and run accident has actually increased. In fact, reports between 2009 to 2011 show they rose by almost 14%. Here are three situations that deal with hit and run accidents and what you should (and shouldn’t) do.</span></p><h3>If You Hit Another Car or Pedestrian</h3><p>This can be one of the scariest situations, especially if you hit a pedestrian. </p><p>- Never flee the scene. You are probably scared and panicked, but if you flee the scene you not only automatically look guilty, but it's also against the law. Its better to stay and explain what happened - especially if it was an honest mistake on your end.</p><p>- Call the police, an ambulance, and your Colorado car accident attorney.</p><p>- Give the person you hit your information, insurance information, etc. If the person you hit won't or can't talk, wait for first responders and your Colorado car accident attorney to arrive and figure out what to do then.</p><p>- If the person you hit is hurt, make sure you wait for the ambulance.</p><p>- Don't admit anything or say too much. Remember: anything you say will be used against you in court!</p><p>- Call your insurance company and let them know what happened.</p><h3>What To Do If You Hit A Person's Home or Vehicle</h3><p>If you were driving down the street and suddenly crashed into a parked car or someone's home, this can be a very terrifying situation. Your flight or fight mode will probably come into play and you may feel the urge to leave - but don’t. </p><p>Instead:</p><p>- Locate the person who owns the car or house. If you cannot locate them call the police and your Colorado car accident attorney. The attorney will add additional support when you need them, but they will also be a good legal representation to have in a situation like this. The police will also be able to help you find the owner of the car or home.</p><p>- If you find the individual let them know what happened and leave them your insurance and personal information.</p><p>Even if you hit something that is not a car or a home, such as a tree or a hydrant. Don't run. Call the police, explain the situation, and then deal with the aftermath. </p><h3>What To Do If You Were A Victim</h3><p>If you were the victim of a hit and run – whether it was a vehicular accident or you were the pedestrian, you may or may not be able to get the proper information; depending on how injured you are.</p><p><strong><em>If you are able to communicate:</em></strong><br></p><p>- Remember what type of car hit you, the make, the model, the color or anything else you can remember. If you saw a license plate that is even more helpful.</p><p>- Call the police immediately and let the operator know you were the victim of a hit and run.</p><p>- Call your Colorado car accident attorney.</p><p>- Call your insurance company</p><p><em><strong>If you are unable to commun</strong>icate:</em></p><p>- Remember as much as you can</p><p>- Have someone help you contact your Colorado car accident attorney as soon as you are able.</p><p>Whether you are at fault in an <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/auto_acci\" target=\"_blank\">accident</a> or someone else is, being in any type of a car accident can be a scary, upsetting and confusing situation.

    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Everyday car accidents happen. Just look at the daily news reports and you will see a barrage of incidents involving vehicular accidents. At some point or another, no matter how careful you are, chances are you will be in a car accident. If this happens you will need to hire a lawyer to help you get fully compensated for damages related to the accident. What exactly are the benefits of hiring an attorney to represent your case after a car accident? Below, you will see a few of the major benefits of hiring a lawyer who has experience in car accident law.</span></p><p>When you hire a lawyer you want to be assured that they have the skills and experience to effectively represent your case. Make sure the lawyer you hire specifically works with your type of case. When you hire a lawyer you have someone who has the knowledge and skills for all things law. This includes procedures that govern and may have an effect on your case. You can also expect the lawsuit will be filed your behalf and your lawyer know different ways to negotiate through the lawsuit for the largest benefit.</p><p>When you hire a lawyer, you can expect them to negotiate for your claim and have an open channel of communication when it comes to the medical provider, as well as the insurance company. When the lawyer contacts the medical provider they will get an assessment of the damage that has been done. Imagine having to do all of these things on your own – especially if you were severely hurt in the accident. The last thing you would want to do is have to take care of all these legal proceedings!</p><p>Whether your injuries were minor or major, your lawyer will not only negotiate and process the claim, but they will also take care of the paperwork for the lawsuit and deal with the defense attorney on your behalf, so they can help you get you as much compensation as you deserve. Not only does compensation involve money to pay for your medical bills, prescriptions and surgeries, but can also help with loss of income. If you were injured to the point of being unable to work in a car accident where someone else was at fault, you would receive a certain amount of money for the injury, as well as loss of income.</p><p>Car accident lawyers deal with a wide range of issues. When you are looking to hire one, make sure you find one who:</p><p>- Offers a <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">free consultation</a>: This way you can sit down with them and make sure that they can handle your type of case – or make sure you even have a case to begin with!</p><p>- Has time for your case: Lawyers lead pretty busy business lives. Sometimes they can get so busy taking on new clients that they don’t have time for more clients. Make sure that they can handle the case and do have ample time to spend on it.</p><p>- Offers the fee structure you can work with. Each lawyer offers a different fee. Make sure that when you sit down to talk that you ask about the fees and when the fees and when they will need to be paid.</p><p>If you’ve been in a<a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/auto_acci\" target=\"_blank\">car accident</a>and need a consultation or help with your case contact <a data-cke-saved-href=\"\" href=\"\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> for more information.

    "header": "Who is Responsible When You are the Victim of a Truck Accident?",
    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Truck accidents create an entirely new level of complexity in terms of personal injury law. When accidents involve commercial vehicles, figuring out whether the business or driver is responsible can cause its own issues. Truck accident lawyers generally work with collisions involving 18-wheelers, which are premised on the doctrine of contributory or comparative negligence.</span></p><p>Comparative Negligence allows Defendants to raise a partial defense which <a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/legalnewsline/2017/05/05/apple-says-iphone-that-allegedly-exploded-in-owners-pocket-not-its-fault/#4306f8872bfb\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/legalnewsline/2017/05/05/apple-says-iphone-that-allegedly-exploded-in-owners-pocket-not-its-fault/#4306f8872bfb\">allocates a portion of the fault </a>to the plaintiff. Both drivers can be held responsible if they’ve acted negligently. As an example, one driver could be found 10% at fault and the other 90%. Compensation will be divided accordingly. Pure comparative negligence applies in jurisdictions where accident victims can be compensated regardless of whether they were negligent themselves. In contrast, modified comparative negligence requires the victim’s fault to be over a particular level before they can recover damages.</p><p>Commercial trucks are heavy and large, so can put an accident victim at a dire disadvantage. Cases will be guided by The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which regulates maintenance, qualifications, and methods of securing cargo. The company’s responsibility for collisions isn’t always easy to establish, especially when a defective part or vehicle manufacturer is partially at fault. If the collision was caused by a defective vehicle, you may be eligible for a product liability claim against the manufacturer.</p><p>Your truck accident lawyers will need to prove the defendant breached their duty of care. The cause of the <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/truck\" target=\"_blank\">acciden</a>t and the damages it caused add further details to investigate. Determining if there was any falsification of logbooks or neglect of other regulations will play a role in the case, but insurance will also be considered. </p><p>Employer negligence occurs when management neglects solid hiring practices or supervision. In some cases, employers are even held entirely responsible for accidents which were completely the fault of the driver, but employees who act with intent are generally held responsible for the damages they caused.</p><p>This principle holds the employer liable for any negligence of staff as long as the accident was unintentional and happened during their employment. The policy is built on the belief that a certain degree of error by staff is to be expected and the superior should answer for it. Preventative action is always best in this case.</p><p>Truck accident lawyers working for the plaintiff must establish that the driver is an employee, not a contractor. Contractors have control over how their work is performed, so they must also assume more legal responsibility for their mistakes. Employers control the way their staff work, so they must step up to the plate when their decisions cause accidents. Figuring out what constitutes scope of employment is more complicated than you may think. It’s established by the motives of the employee, the time and place of the collision, and the amount of freedom they have while doing their duties. For example, if a driver used his vehicle to perform a private errand before his work hours officially end, the business should not be held liable if an accident occurs.</p><p>When the <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/death\" target=\"_blank\">victim of an accident dies</a>, money is an unsatisfactory substitute, but it holds the defendant responsible for harm, which can have a dramatic effect on their future actions.

    "header": "5 Tips From Colorado Car Accident Lawyers",
    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Colorado is a unique state when it comes to your statute of limitations and a concept known as comparative fault. Colorado car accident lawyers will tell you that a statute of limitations is the timeframe within which you can bring a legal action against someone. In contrast, comparative fault relates to your compensation.</span></p><h3>Statute of Limitations in Colorado </h3><p>If you've suffered an auto or motorcycle accident in Colorado you should know that you have three years from the date of your accident to file a lawsuit. If you are also seeking damages for a vehicle or home that was hit in the accident, you also have three years to receive compensation in court should you win your lawsuit with the help of experienced Colorado car accident lawyers. </p><p>There are a few exceptions and caveats to this three-year timeline you should be aware of if you've recently been in an accident. The three-year statute of limitations applies to the amount of time from the date of your accident in which you have to file a accident claim against another individual.</p><p>There is a much smaller timeframe to file a lawsuit if you have had an accident with a municipal vehicle like a city bus or police vehicle. For these kinds of accidents you may need to contact the state of Colorado and/or your municipal government to get an administrative claim going. Of course, Colorado car accident lawyers can walk you through that process. </p><h3>File an Accident Report and Contact Law Enforcement </h3><p>In Colorado, you must immediately report all traffic accidents to law enforcement. If, for whatever reason, an officer is not involved in the process you must file an online accident report. </p><h3>File Your Insurance Claim Early On </h3><p>Remember that the three-year statute of limitations applies to your timeframe in which to file a lawsuit and ultimately receive compensation rather than the amount of time you have to file a claim with your insurance company.</p><p>Make sure to take pictures of your vehicle soon after the accident, visit a doctor to check for signs of injuries, and file an insurance claim as early as possible to expedite the investigation. Filing early gives you the most legal rights. </p><h3>Colorado is a Comparative-fault State </h3><p>Because Colorado is a comparative-fault state when it comes to car accidents, you could be entitled to a different level of compensation than you originally thought. Comparative fault is also known as comparative negligence in the field of personal injury law. So, what does comparative negligence mean for you? </p><p>Comparative negligence means that a plaintiff may recover less compensation if the judge determines that your actions made you partially at fault on the day of the accident. If the jury determines you violated a traffic rule that contributed to the accident and you are considered 20% at fault, in the situation where you win, only 80% of your medical bills, lost wages, etc. would be covered by the Defendant. </p><h3>Consult Legal Help to Work Out Negligence, Premises Liability, and Comparative Fault </h3><p>It's important that you work with experienced Colorado car accident lawyers who can help you throughout your case. Sloat &amp; Nicholson is one of the most trusted personal injury law firms helping clients in Boulder, Colorado. </p><p>Whether you've been in a <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/slip\" target=\"_blank\">slip-and-fall accident</a> or <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/auto_acci\">car accident</a>, the experienced attorneys at Sloat &amp; Nicholson can work with you to enable you to better understand your legal options. Because Colorado is a comparative negligence state you may find yourself entitled to more compensation than you initially thought. </p><p>The amount of negligence involved, how much that negligence affected your personal injury, and the degree to which the owner of the property failed to fulfill his duty of maintaining a safe environment largely determines the amount of compensation you can expect. </p><p><a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\">Contact Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> if you think your <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas\" target=\"_blank\">personal injury</a> is the result of a property owner's negligence or the negligence of another driver. </p>"

    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Most people don't imagine themselves getting into auto accidents because they consider themselves as safe drivers. But everyone faces a certain risk when they get behind the wheel, since other drivers may not be as conscious about safety. If you are ever involved in an accident that results in passenger injuries, here are key facts you need to know.</span></p><h3>How to Respond to an Accident</h3><p>From <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/motor\" target=\"_blank\">motorcycle accidents</a> to <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/truck\" target=\"_blank\">large truck accidents</a>, one of the top reasons why collisions occur is because drivers lose focus on safety for others and themselves. Some accidents may be caused by slippery roads or road hazards. Others are caused by distractions. The most severe cases may result in a wrongful death suit against a negligent driver. In 2016 there were over 600 deaths from vehicle accidents in Colorado, including 125 motorcyclists. </p><p>If you are involved in any type of vehicle accident, <a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.dmv.com/co/colorado/auto-accidents\" href=\"https://www.dmv.com/co/colorado/auto-accidents\" target=\"_blank\">you must not leave the scene</a>. Be sure to call 911 if there are injuries to report and exchange contact information (name, phone number, insurance information) with others involved. Whether you are a victim or the person who caused the incident, you should immediately consult with an attorney who is experienced in personal injury cases. It's possible the case can be settled out of court. </p><p>You are also entitled to compensation if you are a passenger who suffers injuries which lead to medical bills or lost income, as well as pain and suffering. Since passengers usually do not cause traffic accidents, it's easier to recover money from the insurance company of the driver who caused the accident. Your case will be considered a third party injury claim. It's even possible to file multiple claims, depending on how many drivers were involved. </p><p><br></p><h3>Seeking a Settlement for Medical Treatment</h3><p>To be awarded a settlement by an insurance company, you will need to be examined by a doctor.

    "header": "Why Following The Speed Limit Is Important",
    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\" rel=\"background-color: transparent;\">Not only is speeding on roadways illegal, but it's considered to the #1 reason behind <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/auto_acci\" target=\"_blank\">car accidents</a>. Speeding is when a person goes over the posted legal limit on roads, side roads, byways, highways or just about any other type of driving road. Beyond speeding just being illegal, driving while speeding in bad conditions is what leads to many of the car accidents that happen. During the winter when roads are icy, wet or snowy - driving faster can cause your vehicle to go out of control or slide into someone else.</span></p><p>According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in 2011 alone, 80% of the car accidents that resulted in fatalities were due to individuals going over the posted speed limits on local roads. This is a percentage that should make you pause. 80% is a significantly large number.</p><p>One of the biggest reasons why our federal and local state governments determine the proper speeds in each zone isn’t just about speeding. Its about giving the driver ample time to stop. If a driver is on a road and the driver is going 30 mph when a person suddenly walks out into the street, the lower speed should give the driver enough time to stop. On the other hand, if the speed limit is 30 and the driver is going 40, this will not give them enough time to put on the brakes and stop before hitting someone. A pedestrian being hit at even 18 miles per hour can cause serious injury - or even death.</p><p>Not only is going over the speed limit a possible detriment to the person who gets hit – but also to the driver. If the driver hits someone and they get injured they could be looking at not only a fine but also possible jail time.</p><p>If you have been injured in an accident because of someone else's negligence in paying attention to the road or because of speeding, it's definitely in your best interest to call <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/faqs\" target=\"_blank\">The Law Firm of Sloat &amp; Nicholson P.C</a>.

    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\" rel=\"background-color: transparent;\">In 2016, over 600 deaths occurred on Colorado roads. Fatal <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/auto_acci\" target=\"_blank\">car accident</a> statistics continue to rise despite efforts to reduce the disturbing trend. It's vitally important to identify the source of accidental deaths on roadways and help fix the downward spiral. Awareness is key. What are some main causes of auto accidents? The number one most common instigator of automobile accidents may surprise you.</span></p><p>1. The leading cause of auto accidents in America is categorized as distracted driving. Driving errors constantly occur but the use of cell phones is by far the most common cause that falls under the distracted driving category. Phone calls and texting contribute to close to 2 million vehicle crashes annually.</p><p>2. Drivers who choose to speed make driving on the widely diverse terrain of Colorado roadways a dangerous endeavor. Increased speeds lower driver reaction time. The slower a driver reacts the less likely they are to avoid potential accidents.</p><p>3. Weather conditions such as heavy rain, sleet or snow are synonymous with creating hazardous driving environments. Inclement weather poses a real problem for local drivers and the tourist industry when little preparation is done to prevent life-changing accidents from wreaking havoc on your day to day driving.</p><p>4. Tail-gating, numerous lane changes, speed, and impatience are tacked under the reckless driving column. Reckless driving, especially in heavy traffic, is repetitively a trigger for automobile accidents. Extra care is needed to avoid those who engage in careless aggressive driving. </p><p>5. Wrongful death occurs when red lights are not followed accordingly. Side-car impact vehicular accidents at high speeds happen as a result of those who don't yield to traffic light directives. Disastrous repercussions could be avoided if even those who have the right of way ensure that other drivers on the road are also yielding accordingly. </p><p>6. Drivers who ignore stop signs have led to thousands of serious car accidents annually. The <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/tbi\" target=\"_blank\">injuries</a> caused by rollover accidents can be deadly and \"look both ways\" is not only good road etiquette, but many times a life-saving decision. </p><p>These causes of auto accidents shouldn't continually victimize your quality of life!

    "header": "5 Reasons Why You Need a Boulder Car Accident Attorney When You’re Seriously Injured",
    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">When you are seriously injured in an auto accident, it makes sense to immediately consult with a Boulder <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/auto_acci\" target=\"_blank\">car accident</a> attorney. While you may feel confident in your ability to handle your case without professional help, you'll soon realize that presenting an injury claim requires a lot of hard work and legal expertise.</span></p><p>When you should be working your way back from painful disabilities, you'll have to comply with insurance adjuster requests. Before you see a single dime of settlement money, there is a long list of procedures and issues to follow through. It will be your job to contact doctors for bills and reports. Taking care of a serious injury case on your own involves focus on investigation, evaluation, and negotiation. Instead of taking on these new challenges, you should be working on your personal recovery.</p><p>When you are seriously injured, your financial future depends on obtaining adequate compensation for your injuries. You have a lot at stake. That's why it's important to seek help from a Boulder car accident attorney before you make a critical mistake. Here are 5 additional reasons to consider. </p><p>Accidents often involve liability issues that can be difficult to resolve. Colorado's comparative negligence statute plays a key role in liability assessments. You must determine whether or not you contributed to the circumstances which caused the accident and how it may affect the compensation you receive for your injuries. </p><p>When you have a serious injury claim, the other driver’s insurance company adjuster will call and may want to visit your home. It’s an adjuster’s job to clear up any liability issues, so they must record your statement. If you are nervous, you may provide inaccurate or ambiguous answers that can sabotage your claim. The insurance company might not refuse to pay, but they could push for a lower settlement than you deserve.</p><p>Boulder car accident attorneys deal with the same insurance companies on a regular basis. Their liability adjusters understand that attorneys are professionals at investigating, evaluating, and negotiating auto injury claims. Adjusters realize they can’t get away with bad faith tactics when they are dealing with legal professionals. They are less likely to deny a legitimate claim or play lowball settlement games.</p><p>When you’re injured, you know the pain, disabilities, and scarring you are forced to endure, but do you know their economic value? Injury claims don't have one-size-fits-all evaluations. If two different people sustain the same injury, the settlement value will be different due to a wide range of factors. Attorneys research your injuries to understand how they affect you. They establish an accurate value before presenting your claim. </p><p>If you begin handling your own claim then change your mind, a Boulder car accident attorney can still handle it on your behalf. Unfortunately, a delay can put your attorney at a disadvantage in investigating key issues. Your case won’t be impossible to resolve, but it will be more of a challenge to handle.</p><p>At  <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/attorneys-staff\" target=\"_blank\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson,</a> we understand that serious injuries have long-term consequences, but you don't have to go it alone. We work hard to get the compensation you need to get your life back to normal.

    "header": "6 Signs You Should Get a New Colorado Attorney",
    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">If you have been injured in an accident of some kind, it's important to work with a Colorado attorney to give yourself the best chance at receiving the largest possible settlement. Unfortunately, not all attorneys are good at what they do or have your best interests in mind. This can be a serious problem if you've already hired an attorney.</span></p><p>The following are six signs that it might be time to cut your current attorney loose:</p><p>A good lawyer will work with personal injury victims on a contingency basis. This means that instead of being billed for their services every week, you won't be responsible for paying for their legal representation until after the case is finished. In fact, the most reputable attorneys won't charge you unless you win the case. They will simply take the money you owe for their services from your settlement. By doing this, you won't have to worry about losing money over the course of your case.</p><p>If your lawyer is taking too long to put together your case or complete simple tasks, it generally means they are either overworked or they don't know what they are doing. This can be extremely problematic when it comes to the possibility of an actual trial since they will have to meet real deadlines that could affect the outcome of your case.</p><p>If your lawyer keeps asking you to fill out documents and paperwork you have already filled out, it's a red flag of disorganization. If they can't even keep track of the work you've already done, how are they going to keep track of the evidence they've collected or paperwork that's required by the court?</p><p>If it takes days for your lawyer to respond to your emails or phone calls, or they don't respond at all, there's a serious problem. Either they don't care about your case, they have bad communication skills, they're disorganized or they have too many cases that they are working on at the same time. Whatever the reason may be, it's most likely going to hurt your case.</p><p>Pay attention to how your lawyer is billing you. There are lawyers out there who take advantage of their clients because their clients don't know better. Be aware of possible over billing or excessive billing. </p><p>Additionally, keep an eye out for vague billing, which means being billed for items which contain no details. For example, a billed phone call should include the names of all parties involved, the time it lasted, what was spoken about and when the call was made. You should also watch out for surcharges on legal expenses and hidden expenses.</p><p>It's going to be difficult to have confidence in a lawyer who doesn't have a good attitude. You want to work with a lawyer who cares about you, your case, and who has a positive attitude throughout the proceedings. A poor attitude or disinterest not only strains your professional relationship, but can also reflect on your case.</p><p>These are six signs that you need to switch to a new Colorado attorney. <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">Contact us</a> at <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">Sloan &amp; Nicholson</a> by calling 1-800-873-3202 to schedule a <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/faqs\" target=\"_blank\">free consultation</a> today.</p>"

In Colorado,<a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/auto_acci\" target=\"_blank\">auto accident</a> law allows three years from the time an injury was sustained for a claim for compensation to be made. It is three years for auto accidents and two years for other kinds of injuries. However, in some situations, there are shorter time limits, as well as a requirement of notice to governmental entities which has to be done in 180 days.</p><p>When your life has been abruptly interrupted by an accident, your first concern is getting medical treatment. You don't need the added stress of thinking of how you will come up with the money to pay an attorney to get you the compensation you deserve. Sloat &amp; Nicholson P.C work on a contingency basis where our payment is a percentage of the amount we collect for you as damages. </p><p>In an attempt to minimize the amount they offer in compensation, the insurance company of the party at fault will rush over to you with papers for you to sign. The amount they offer in compensation will not always be enough to cover all the damages you have suffered. Signing the papers means that you accept what the insurance company is offering and you will pursue further compensation.</p><p>It's our recommendation that you do not put your signature on the release forms you receive from the other party's insurance company. Do not give a recorded statement.

What can be even worse is the other party, or often their insurance company, leaves you hanging out to dry when it comes to compensation. Turning to a Boulder accident lawyer to handle your case can ease your mind at a time when you need to focus on getting healthy.</span></p><p>Getting your side of the story is important when it comes to developing a strategy, presenting your case, and calculating a dollar amount you would like to see from the other side. An initial consultation generally does not take very long. If your case has merit, follow-up consultations can be scheduled.</p><p>When the other side finds out they are dealing with a Boulder accident lawyer, they know that you are serious about your case. At this point, the other side will be given the chance to respond. If they decide to settle quickly, this will allow you to get paid in relatively short order, without going through a trial. Lawyers usually work as the points of contact between their client and the defendant. You personally would not have to talk to their lawyers or anyone else other than your attorney.</p><p>If a settlement cannot be reached, your <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/attorneys-staff\" target=\"_blank\">lawyer</a> will file a lawsuit to bring the issue in front of a judge and jury. This will get the other side's attention since they cannot stall any longer. On the court date, they will have to justify why they aren't compensating you. This can sometimes push the other party towards a settlement when they do not want to pay legal fees for what would probably be a losing case.</p><p>An experienced Boulder <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/auto_acci\" target=\"_blank\">accident</a> lawyer will present your case in a way that gives you the best chance to receive the highest award. This may include getting depositions, issuing subpoenas, doing outside research, etc. Even at this late point in the process your lawyer and the defense attorney may be able to work out a deal before a judge rules on it. If the other side so chooses, they may even try striking a deal the day of the trial.</p><p>Once a judge has decided in your favor, they will issue you an award that the other side will have to pay. Sometimes, the party at fault, or their insurance company, may choose to appeal to a higher court. But if they lost decisively in the first court case, there is a good chance they may lose again on appeal. It would also cost the defendant a considerable amount more in legal fees if they do appeal. Generally, the defendant's side will cut a check to your attorney, who will take their fees and expenses, and the rest will be sent to you, so you can cover any necessary expenses.</p><p><a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson P.C.</a> serves as personal injury lawyers around the Boulder area, as well as throughout the rest of Colorado.

Otherwise, you must contact the local police to report the accident as soon as possible.</p><p>With smartphones in common use, it is now possible to file your auto accident report with the Colorado DMV online while still at the scene of the accident.</p><p>Online reporting only satisfies your duty to report the accident in cases where there were no serious injuries requiring medical attention, no fatalities, no hit and run incident, no DUI or DUID on either driver, no public property was damaged, and both drivers were insured and had a valid driver's license.</p><p>You can also report qualifying accidents via \"snail mail\" using the downloadable and printable <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.dmv.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcrash.state.co.us%2F447-E.pdf\" href=\"http://www.dmv.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcrash.state.co.us%2F447-E.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Accident Report form</a> by sending it to State of Colorado, Motor Vehicle Division, Traffic Records, Denver, CO 80261.</p><p>Gaining access to the police-filed accident report is critical if you were injured and need to file a claim or will be in any other form of legal struggle regarding the accident.</p><p>To get a copy of your auto accident report, you need to file <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/DR2489.pdf\" href=\"http://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/DR2489.pdf\">form DR2489</a> and pay a fee (of less than $3). This form not only requests the report but also serves as an affidavit of how you intend to use the information in the accident report. You may wish to speak with a good Colorado lawyer before filling out and mailing in the affidavit since it could affect how your future case, if any, will proceed.</p><p>Your requested auto accident report should arrive in the mail within 90 days of filing DR2489. You can request the report up to seven years after the accident. But for tort actions, remember that the Colorado statute of limitations on car accident injuries in 3 years from date of injury.</p><p>For help in filing or requesting your auto accident report, <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact</a> the  Boulder accident lawyers at <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> anytime 24/7 by calling <strong>800-873-3202</strong> or <strong>303-447-1144</strong>.</p>"

    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">When someone is killed by another person due to negligence or other provable fault, the survivors can initiate a wrongful death lawsuit against the responsible party or the company that employs them. A wrongful death lawsuit generally seeks compensation for funeral expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and punitive damages. Here is a quick rundown on the basic process:</span></p><p><a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/death\" target=\"_blank\">Wrongful death lawsuits</a> can be brought about for a variety of reasons. These include include deaths caused by automobile, motorcycle and large truck accidents, medical malpractice, or slip and fall incidents. People, companies, and governmental agencies can all be legally at fault for acting negligently or for acting intentionally.</p><p>A wrongful death claim is brought against seemingly responsible entities, such as individuals, companies (and their employees) or government agencies. For example, the driver of a car, motorcycle or large truck who disobeys the law and subsequently may be liable for any deaths that they cause. Other examples are: engineering or construction firms that build a faulty structure, doctors who are guilty of malpractice, and even bartenders who serve a patron \"one too many\" can be legally culpable for their actions – whether intentional or not.</p><p>After the death of an individual, a wrongful suit claim can be filed by an attorney on behalf of the survivors. In general, family members or sometimes distant relatives, life partners whether married in the eyes of the law or not and any other person who suffers from the death financially – business partners, employers and the like – are all entitled to sue because of the harm done to them both personally and financially.</p><p>Contending with a wrongful death lawsuit is always difficult for the plaintiffs. They must be prosecuted properly to help take care of the spouse or children left behind.

When you have access to a lawyer who has a proven record of winning settlements for their clients, the chances of experiencing the same success is greatly increased.</p><p>Ask the brain injury law firm you are interested in about their trial experience and for details on previous cases they have handled that were similar to yours. </p><h3>#2 – Glowing Reviews from Past Clients </h3><p>You might bypass reading reviews on a lot of purchases, but investing in a lawyer should definitely not be one of those times.</p><p>Make sure you do your due diligence before deciding on legal representation and read reviews from as many sources as you can find. This will give you a very clear indication on what type of results you can expect when working with your attorney. </p><h3>#3 – Specializes in Traumatic Brain Injury </h3><p>Every lawyer will specialize in something different. Finding a law firm that specializes in traumatic brain injuries will ensure you are getting proper representation from lawyers who are knowledgeable and skilled in this area. </p><h3>#4 – The Right Amount of Experience </h3><p>Even though experience isn't everything, it is extremely helpful when trying to win a traumatic brain injury case.</p><p>A lawyer who has several years of experience trying this type of case will be able to fall back on their wisdom whenever necessary. This is the type of lawyer you want to have on your side during such a stressful, and sometimes frustrating, process. </p><h3>#5 – Compassionate and Caring </h3><p>Above all else, you want a traumatic brain injury law firm that truly cares. Make sure you meet with your lawyer in-person before signing up for services and pay attention to how they make you feel when evaluating your case. </p><p>If you or a loved one have suffered a traumatic brain injury, <strong><a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com\">schedule your free consultation</a></strong> with <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson</a> today. </p>"

    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">By its very nature a personal injury is a physically traumatic event. Unfortunately, it can sometimes become a mental one when dealing with all the parties involved. For this reason, it is often necessary to hire a personal injury attorney to help with the situation. Here are just a few times when it is advisable to do so:</span></p><p><strong>The case becomes complicated</strong> – The law is complex and requires specialized training and knowledge to understand its intricacies. This is the main reason you hire a lawyer in the first place. In addition, the injury that you have suffered may cause other difficulties in terms of mobility or concentration making it doubly difficult for you to resolve the case on your own. An experienced personal injury attorney can help resolve any and all of these issues.</p><p><strong>The insurance company refuses to settle</strong> – It is not an unusual negotiating tactic for a large insurance company to deny coverage or its liability in a personal injury case. By delaying a settlement, they hope to discourage you from aggressively pursuing the case or eventually settling for a lesser amount. An experienced attorney will recognize this situation and take the appropriate legal steps to make the insurance company act in good faith and in a timely manner.</p><p>The government claims immunity – While an individual has the right to sue the government at any level, it is an arduous task. The entire process is tightly controlled and governed by such things as “sovereign immunity” and the “tort claims act.” If you are not familiar with the details behind these then, you need a personal injury attorney to represent you.</p><p>A <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/faqs\" target=\"_blank\">personal injury</a> is serious business. In addition to the physical pain and mental anguish, there are bills to pay. Do not shortchange yourself by simply settling for the first offer from an insurance company. Get advice from an experienced attorney.

    "text": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s Highway Loss Data Institute, Colorado experienced 488 fatalities as a result of motor vehicle accidents. More than half of these fatal <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/practice_areas/auto_acci\" target=\"_blank\">car accidents</a> were single vehicle crashes. Distracted driving has emerged as one of the leading contributors to vehicle accidents. Here are some causes of distracted driving and what you should do to keep yourself safe on the road.</span></p><p>SafeStart.com maintains that nearly two-thirds (62%) of distracted driving is caused by drivers who are “lost in thought” and not focused on the task at hand. If you are emotional or attempting to juggle too many tasks at once, consider taking some time to calm down before getting out on the road.</p><p>It seems that everyone has a cell phone and we all know someone who has used their cell phone to make a phone call or send a text while driving. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that any moment during the day up to 660,000 drivers are using their cell phones. Rather than sending that text while driving, pull over to the side of the road to get your message out.</p><p>When you’re driving with others in the car, you can be distracted by a conversation with family or friends. Children in the backseat can also demand your immediate attention, taking your mind away from the task at hand.</p><p>If your passengers are causing a distraction, excuse yourself from the conversation. If you need to help your children, pull over before turning your attention to the backseat.</p><p>Distracted driving is one of the most preventable causes of car accidents. Put your cell phone on mute and start your journey with a clear mind.</p><p>If you have any questions about distracted driving or you would like to schedule an appointment with one of the attorneys at <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/attorneys-staff\" target=\"_blank\">Sloat Law</a> to discuss the details of your case, please <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">feel free to contact us</a> at 303-447-1144 or 800-873-3202.</p>"

Here is a look at some of the common causes of wrongful death:</span></p><p>Motorists have an obligation to obey road and traffic laws. They must also operate motor vehicles with caution and regard for the safety of other drivers.

For instance, explosions, falls, equipment accidents and burns are some of the work-related accidents that cause numerous deaths in the manufacturing, construction and mining industry. If you suspect the passing of your loved one was caused by his/her employer’s recklessness or negligence, then you may file a wrongful death claim.

It is important to consult a qualified wrongful death lawyer in Boulder if you experience the loss of a loved one in what is perceived to be medical malpractice.</p><p>The law may deem a person’s death wrongful if it has been caused by a negligent or reckless act of another person or if there was intent to kill or harm.

Those who survive accidents involving larger vehicles often suffer spinal cord or brain injuries, amputation, burn injuries, or permanent scars – both physically and emotionally. It’s not at all uncommon for injuries to be so severe that they prevent motorcyclists from taking care of themselves, performing daily tasks around the home, returning to work, or ever riding again.</span></p><p>Motorcycle accident victims deserve fair compensation for medical bills, lost wages, physical pain, scarring and a reduction in quality of life. In addition to the real physical and emotional issues you suffer following an accident, there’s the uncertainty about your future. How and when are you going to be able to support yourself and your family, pay mounting medical bills, and resume a normal life?</p><p>When you’re injured in an accident, the person at fault is negligent. If another driver caused your motorcycle accident, they are the negligent party. On the other hand, if your accident and injuries resulted from debris in the roadway or poorly marked road hazards, there’s a possibility that the city or county is the negligent party. In Boulder, your <a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact_us\" href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact_us\">motorcycle accident attorney</a> will know how and where to start your case.</p><p>Insurance companies want to settle your case as quickly as possible – and certainly not in your favor. They’ll count on you to take their first offer and settle the case for the lowest cost (to them). Never speak with an insurance representative about your motorcycle accident until first consulting a motorcycle accident attorney about your case.</p><p>Even though you’ve found the best attorney for your case, it’s important to stay involved. While your attorney will make strategic choices during the process of presenting your lawsuit or injury claim, the final decisions are yours. A good motorcycle accident attorney brings with him a multitude of skills, knowledge and experience from experience with many personal injury cases. Your attorney knows what needs to be done, and will advise you on how much you can expect from your settlement.</p><p>If you or a love one suffered injuries in a motorcycle accident, contact <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">Sloat &amp; Nicholson, P.C</a>., in Boulder for a free consultation.

Exchange insurance information</h3><p>This might seem like a no-brainer, but after an accident, you aren’t always in a position to collect and exchange insurance information. However, always ensure you get this information as quickly as possible after the accident.</p><h3>2. Always obtain a police report</h3><p>You will undoubtedly be expected to provide a police report when you file a personal injury claim. Contact the police department who handled your case in order to obtain a copy of it.</p><h3>3. Gather information from witnesses</h3><p>Witnesses will often have crucial information about the scene of the accident. You want to seek out all of these witnesses and make sure you have their contact information at your fingertips.</p><h3>4. Take as many videos and photos as possible</h3><p>Physical evidence, in the form of photographs and videos, greatly increases your chances of winning a personal injury lawsuit. If you were unable to take pictures or video, ask eye witnesses if they were able to get anything&nbsp;on camera.</p><h3>5. Seek medical attention immediately</h3><p>Even if you are not immediately aware of any injuries, it is critical to have yourself evaluated by medical professionals. It is equally important to follow through on doctors’ orders and show up to every appointment you make.</p><h3>6. Don’t wait to retain legal representation</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/attorneys_staff\" target=\"_blank\">Consult a lawyer </a>right away. Too many people wait to seek legal advice and this decreases the chances of them winning their case. The sooner you are represented by an accident attorney in Colorado, the better.</p><h3>7. Understand your rights</h3><p>If you don’t understand how much you should be compensated, you will likely end up getting less than&nbsp;you deserve. Make sure you are aware of the long list of damages and expenses you may be entitled to.</p><h3>8. Don’t hire the wrong attorney</h3><p>When searching for an accident attorney in Colorado, you want to make sure the one you hire will always have your best interests at heart. Avoid lawyers who promise to “loan” you money or push you into a quick settlement.</p><p>Need more information about how <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com\" target=\"_blank\">Sloat Law</a> can help you?

The CDC estimates that 8 people every day are killed, and 1,161 are injured by distracted drivers. A few seconds of inattentiveness is all it takes to cause a lifetime of pain and suffering to victims of these accidents.</p><p>There are three types of distracted driving that motorists should be aware of. There are visual distractions that take your eyes off the road, manual distractions that include removing your hand from the wheel or gear shift, and cognitive distractions that take your thoughts away from driving.</p><p><strong>Drugs Cause Distracted Driving Accidents </strong></p><p>Drugs are frequently cited in distracted driving accidents. In early July, Dylan <span>Gottschling</span> chose to consume heroin and <span>Xanax</span> before getting&nbsp;behind the wheel of his Subaru WRX sedan. As <span>Gottschling</span> drove, he decided to send text messages to his friends. The distraction provided by his phone,&nbsp;and the drugs he consumed, caused him to miss a parked SUV in his path. He struck the vehicle at nearly 40 MPH. The impact pushed the SUV into another vehicle, sandwiching Craig <span>Towler</span> between them. Mr. <span>Towler</span> lost his legs in the accident and will face a lifetime of recovery as a result.</p><p>In 2014, the&nbsp;National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that more than 10 million people over the age of 12 admitted&nbsp;consuming&nbsp;illicit drugs before getting behind the wheel. It’s a frighteningly common&nbsp;problem as drugs slow&nbsp;cognitive responses and lead to inattentiveness on the road.

Safe driving will greatly reduce your chances of being in an accident, but there is not a lot that can be done about unsafe drivers causing an accident that is not your fault. Looking at car accident statistics, it is possible to see a couple of patterns emerge that should give you some guidance regarding what to do and not to do while you drive.</p><p>According to the <span>NHTSA</span>, drinking alcohol and&nbsp;having a blood-alcohol content (BAC) of .03 or more results in at least a 20% higher chance of getting into an accident. Once you get up above .10 BAC, which is more than enough for a DUI in Colorado, your chances of getting into an accident are about 10 times higher than someone who has no alcohol in their system. Staying out of the driver’s seat if you have been drinking will significantly reduce the chances of being involved in a crash.</p><p>The majority of car accidents do not result in a fatality, but there are some numbers that highlight when fatalities are likely to occur. The U.S. Department of Transportation states that about 31% of all traffic-related fatalities were caused when someone was behind the wheel of a vehicle with a BAC of more than .02. Since the late <span>1960s</span>, car accident statistics show that the total number of people who <a href=\"http://sloatlaw.com/boulder-wrongful-death-attorneys\" target=\"_blank\">die </a>in auto accidents has steadily dropping, even though the number of drivers&nbsp;has grown significantly. In addition, the number of fatalities per 100 million miles driven in the U.S. has dropped sharply from about 5 in 1969 to 1.08 in 2014.</p><p>Wearing a seat belt was not required in most states until the late <span>1980s</span> and early <span>1990s</span>. As early as 1984, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that wearing a seat belt cuts your chances of being injure or dying in a car crash by about 50%.</p><p>Getting into an accident that is not your fault can bring you undeserved hardship and pain.

    "text": "<p><a href=\"http://sloatlaw.com/boulder-auto-accident-attorneys\" target=\"_blank\">Auto accidents </a>are an unfortunate fact of life for about 98% of U.S. residents, who will at some point in their lives be involved in&nbsp;one. They range in severity from simple fender benders to multi-car pileups with fatalities. It is &nbsp;advantageous for you to find an accident attorney in Boulder who can represent you whether or not the accident was your fault. A few of the more common circumstances where&nbsp;you might need legal representation for accidents include:</p><p>If you believe you are owed&nbsp;financial compensation from another party involved in the accident, you will need an accident attorney in Boulder who knows the<a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/testimonials\" target=\"_blank\"> ins and outs of the law</a> as it pertains to your case. The defendant in your case will absolutely have a lawyer, making it imperative you have someone on your side who can handle the paperwork, filings, and evidence gathering that needs to be done to successfully pursue your claim.</p><p>In cases where you may have been at-fault, you may&nbsp;have to defend yourself from claims brought up by other parties against you. Trying to defend yourself in this type of situation is generally&nbsp;a &nbsp;bad idea, especially when a knowledgeable attorney can more than pay for themselves by reducing&nbsp;the amount of money you owe, or winning the case outright.</p><p>Whether or not you were at-fault for the accident, there is a good chance an insurance company will try to pay out less than they owe. Another party’s insurance company may try suing you for the damages they had to pay to their customer, or your own insurance company may try to refuse your claim, even if the accident was clearly not your fault. Getting<a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact_us\" target=\"_blank\"> legal representation</a> usually shows these companies that you do not intend to take their actions lying down and it often leads them to settling with you.</p>"

    "text": "<p>It’s not unusual for drivers to become distracted or even doze off on the road late at night.&nbsp;Boulder auto accident attorney firms know these scenarios all too well due to their regrettably frequent occurrence. There’s plenty of things drivers can do to avoid becoming distracted to begin with, such as:</p><p>There isn’t quite as much advice available to conscientious people who want to know how to protect themselves from other distracted drivers. However, a good starting point could be learning to recognize an obviously distracted or&nbsp;&nbsp;impaired driver, particularly if they’re intoxicated with alcohol or cannabis.</p><p>Not paying attention is the important thing to look for when identifying drivers who may be dangerous to drive near. A car that constantly switches back and forth between lanes or stops suddenly at red traffic lights and/or stop signs could be operated by either an impaired or a distracted driver, so you’ll want to keep a distance from them or pass them whenever you safely can.</p><p>Drivers who seem to be stuck in the far left lane for what feels like an eternity may be distracted by their mobile phones, since they often don’t think they’ll need to pay attention as much in this lane while using their phones. Some of these drivers can also be in a kind of road trance, where they lose focus on their driving and the road around them. In either case, you’ll want to try to create as much distance between your car and theirs as possible.</p><p>It would be wonderful if distracted driving accidents were relatively uncommon occurrences, but unfortunately that’s not the case. Over 15,000 texting-related accidents were reported in the United States in 2015. Based on the findings of a Colorado Department of Transportation survey, 38% of all Colorado drivers have talked on their phones while driving, and 25% have texted while driving. These are frightening statistics.&nbsp;As a result, <span>CDOT</span> is planning to post road signs to alert Boulder drivers to the risks of auto accidents caused by distracted driving.</p>"

Economic damages are things you can measure like lost wages, medical bills, and repairs. Conversely, noneconomic damages are things you cannot, like pain or emotional distress.</p><p>As a surviving family member, you can bring your own lawsuit for emotional distress or loss of companionship but this is a separate lawsuit. Depending on the court and judge, you might be able to join the actions into single lawsuit however this is not a guarantee.</p><p>Unfortunately, economic damages are usually relatively minor. The real dispute centers on what is referred to as economic potential. Economic potential is like an expanded way to measure lost wages. For a lost wages claim, you add up the number of days you missed due to an accident and multiply that by the amount you earn per day.</p><p>Economic potential is how much you are able to produce in your life. It is based on your age, health, education, work history and ability to bear children, form adult relationships and maintain a family. Essentially everything that you can accomplish during your life is valued. The court adds up all of this potential and assigns a value to represent the amount lost.</p><p>As you probably noticed, a lot of this is based upon work potential and health. This means if your loved one was elderly or sick then the amount you can recover is significantly less. This is due to the fact that they are probably not working, they are unable to bear children and they are approaching the end of their life, they have very little economic potential. So, as far as the court is concerned, even though a life was lost the economic damages are small because he or she was nearing the end of their economic potential.</p><p>The unfortunate effect is that many of these lawsuits, which may have valid claims, are not prosecuted.</p>"

This statute does not apply to individuals who are trespassing on private property, who have intentionally provoked the dog, or certain dog care professionals such as groomers and dog show judges. In addition, it does not apply to any dog that is working in a military or police capacity, or for dogs who are working in ranching, hunting, herding or other related activities.</p><p>Settlements for dog bites are limited to only economic losses when it can be proven that the dog’s owner was negligent in their responsibilities as an owner. This means that the settlement amount will be based on actual past medical bills, future medical bills, psychological treatments, and lost wages due to the injury. Non-economic losses like pain and suffering, emotional distress and reduced quality of life will not be factored into the final agreement.</p><p>In cases where the victim is able to prove that the owner was knowingly negligent in handling the dog, it is possible to make a claim for non-economic damages. The victim must prove that the owner knew the animal’s propensity for aggression and failed to act as any other reasonable owner would in the same situation.

For drivers involved in an accident, it is probably a good idea to gather contact information from witnesses before they leave if they are unable to stay and wait for the police to arrive.</p><p>Finally, the authorities will take into account outside circumstances that may have contributed to the accident. Traffic, road construction, weather conditions and more can have an impact on the way the authorities administer fines and tickets.</p><p>In most cases, the local authorities will be able to determine who was at fault for an accident immediately after it is reported.

Colorado’s <strong><a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/boulder-drunk-driver-attorneys\">drunk driving statistics</a></strong> show that impaired driving is a significant cause of traffic accidents, and the citizens causing these accidents should be held responsible.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: arial; font-size: 14.6667px;\" rel=\"font-family: arial; font-size: 14.6667px;\">In Colorado alone over 26,000 individuals are arrested for impaired driving every year and alcohol-related crashes make up a significant number of all traffic fatalities. In Boulder county alone 1,250 residents had DWAI/DUI charges filed against them with an average blood alcohol level (BAC) of 0.156 (legal limit 0.08). These drunk driving statistics show a significant cause of injury and damage causing accidents.

Ignition interlock devices are 67% more effective at preventing repeat offenses while installed and 39% more effective after removal. In Colorado, all-offender interlock laws reduced drunk driving related deaths by 19%.

In a car accident between two drivers, drivers exchange information, file a report and contact their insurance companies. Injuries sustained aren’t typically as severe.

However, there’s the possibility other parties are responsible too such as:</p><p>• The owner of the trailer or truck<br> • Company or person who leased the trailer or truck from the owner<br> • The truck manufacturer<br> • The loader or shipper of the truck’s cargo<br> • Maintenance companies<br> • Local, state or federal government entities</p><h3><strong>Skilled Legal Assistance is Necessary to Receive the Compensation You Deserve</strong></h3><p>Large truck accident claims are complex because majority of the parties possibly liable for the crash have deep pockets. They use their extra money and legal resources to avoid paying a plaintiff injured through no fault of his own.<br> One tactic used is to keep shifting the blame from party to party. For example, the cause of the collision was the large truck’s faulty brakes. The manufacturer of the defective brakes may try to blame the driver or leasing company claiming the parties failed to maintain the brakes properly.</p><p>If one or more of the negligent parties offers compensation, referred to as a settlement, it may be a low figure.

    "text": "<p>When filing a premises liability claim you must be able to prove you were legally on the property that the property owner was responsible for keeping safe. You will also need to verify the injury you incurred as the result of that property owner’s negligence. The majority of premise liability claims are for, “slip and fall” or “trip and fall” accidents. In the United States, there are approximately 2.5 million slip and fall accidents every year.</p><p>Filing a claim for a slip and fall injury is much like filing an auto accident report. Remember these steps if you or a loved is injured:</p><p>* Get medical attention. You need to receive medical attention immediately after you’ve suffered any injury and this is no different. You will also need your physician’s verification of the injury and the cause of it. If possible, find out if there will be future medical attention necessary for your injuries and how that will affect your ability to work and live normally.</p><p>* File an accident report. Just like you would file an auto accident report after a vehicle accident, you need to file an accident report for your injury. The best time to do this is before you leave the property.</p><p>* Photograph all evidence. If you are physically able, photograph all evidence showing how you fell, including the injury if you can. These photos will help your attorney prove negligence in your case.</p><p>* Obtain all contact information from witnesses. Write down all names and contact information of any person who witnessed your accident. Your attorney may need to contact them for verification.</p><p>* Contact your attorney. <strong>Boulder injury lawyers</strong> will understand how the laws in your area work and will have experience negotiating, if necessary, with insurance companies. Do not talk to any insurance companies before you consult with an experienced personal injury attorney.</p>"

Ask the other driver for his name, license, contact information and insurance information.</p><p>If you have a smartphone or a digital camera on hand, take pictures of your vehicle, the other driver’s vehicle and the vicinity of the accident. If you do not have a camera on hand, try and draw a picture of the accident scene or take notes so that you do not forget any of the accident details.

Even if legally on the property, the statute prevents you from collecting if the owner proves you provoked the dog.</p><p><strong>Compensation Due to Owner’s Negligence</strong></p><p>If the dog bite injury does not rise to the legal definition of serious bodily injury, you may still collect for your damages under the negligence theory.

    "text": "<p>There has been great research done regarding our brains and how they react to an injury. In the case of a brain injury, it is important to seek representation from a <a title=\"Brain Injury Law Firm\" href=\"/boulder-traumatic-brain-injury-attorneys\"><strong>brain injury law firm</strong></a> that is knowledgeable on this topic. A lawyer who is not educated on the latest medical advancements is not likely to represent their clients. A brain injury is not a quick incident to recover from, spiraling into a lifelong issue that occurs after an accident occurs. This is why you deserve proper representation from a brain injury law firm to ensure you get the compensation owed to you.</p><p>Regarding brain injury law, there are some things that you should know:</p><p><strong>The Process Is Difficult</strong></p><p>Your injuries are the primary concern of your lawyer. It is important that medical staff proves your brain injury by way of an MRI or CT scan. This is how you win your legal case. Lack of medical evidence can lead to an unsuccessful case. The sooner you contact a brain injury law firm, the sooner the professionals can ensure the right diagnosis takes place.</p><p><strong>Medical Records</strong></p><p>In order to present a brain injury case, there are medical records that need to be obtained, such as reports from the initial emergency room visit, doctor’s statements at follow up appointments and psychiatric appointments. It can be overwhelming to have to obtain all of this information yourself when you are still recovering, so let your lawyer do the work for you.</p><p><strong>Recovery Can Be Slow</strong></p><p>When you are recovering from a brain injury, you should know that the recovery process can be quite slow, as you have to give the brain long enough to recover on its own. Your attorney ensures that all of the legal burden is taken off your shoulders so you can focus on coping with your injury and getting better.</p><p>In order to focus solely on your recovery, you need to be able to place your trust in a brain injury law firm.

    "text": "<p>When you are injured and hurt in a slip and fall accident, you want the help of a personal injury attorney. It may be obvious the other party is at fault for your accident. That does not mean he or she will willingly pay you. It also does not mean that if the other party is willing to pay, he or she will pay you a fair amount. In fact, many people injured in this type of accident have to file a claim before the case is settled out of court.</p><p><strong>Determining Liability</strong></p><p>Determining who is at fault for your accident is difficult to do without an attorney. It goes beyond just telling the court the other party harmed you. In Colorado, the court wants proof the other party caused your accident. How is liability determined? First, this type of accident falls under premises liability. So the following must be true for the other party to be liable:</p><p>• The premise owner or employee must have caused the dangerous condition. The dangerous condition may be a worn spot, torn spot or slippery surface.</p><p>• The premise owner or employee should have known about the dangerous surface because a reasonable individual taking care of a similar property would have known.</p><p>• The court uses a reasonable person standard to test the other party’s liability. If a reasonable person would have known about the dangerous condition, the other party would have been at fault.</p><p>• The premise owner or employee must have known the area where you slipped was dangerous and did nothing about it.</p><p>The tough part about trying to sue a premise owner without a lawyer is proving that he or she “should have known” about the slippery surface. A personal injury lawyer can find experts who will testify regarding what a premise owner should have known.</p><p><strong>What Does the Word “Reasonable” Really Mean?</strong></p><p>In legal terms the word “reasonable” is determined by asking several different questions like:</p><p>• Was the dangerous condition present long enough for the premise owner to know about it?</p><p>• Does the premise owner have regular procedures for spotting, cleaning and repairing a slippery surface?</p><p>• Were there any factors that contributed to the slip and fall accident, like poor lighting or broken rails?</p><p><strong>Were You Careless?</strong></p><p>The court evaluates the plaintiff’s carelessness in his or her accident. If you were careless and caused or contributed to the slipping and falling, it will stop you from suing, or it will lower your award amount. Some questions the defense lawyer and/ or claims adjuster will ask are:</p><p>• Did you have a legitimate reason for being in the slippery area?</p><p>• Were there any warnings posted about the area being slippery or dangerous?</p><p>• Would a person in your same or similar position have noticed the slippery surface and either avoided it or carefully walked through it?</p><p>• Were you distracted or not paying attention at the time of your accident?</p><p>Slip and fall lawsuits fall in the category of negligence. If you or a loved experienced this type of accident, contact a personal injury lawyer today.</p>"

Most of these accidents occurred because of driver negligence. As required by law from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, semi trucks are held to an entirely different standard, and their accidents are treated differently than those that involve&nbsp;a passenger vehicle, such as a car, pickup truck&nbsp;or motorcycle. Insurance policies on commercial vehicles like&nbsp;semi trucks can cover $1 million, which is why it is important to talk to an accident and injury lawyer about your case.</span></p><p><span><strong>Talk to the Right People</strong></span></p><p><span>After your accident, many people may try to give you advice.

Even if you were&nbsp;injured similarly as someone else&nbsp;on the same road, with the same conditions, it still is not&nbsp;the same. The core circumstances of your&nbsp;accident&nbsp;are different, and the insurance may settle for more or less than the stories you hear.</span></p><p><span><strong>Never Settle Quickly</strong></span></p><p><span>Insurance companies will usually try&nbsp;to settle quickly&nbsp;because it is in their best interest, not because it is in your best interest.

It can also scare a person away from dogs in the future and cause them irrational fear of a bite at any moment.

The emotional toll it takes is already too much, but that person’s absence can also lead to financial difficulties if he or she was the primary breadwinner of a family. A lawyer can carefully navigate legal waters so that dependent family members are paid an amount of money that is equal to how much their loved one was worth before passing. Emotions are also a factor in the final decision regarding damages to be paid. Money can never make up for a loved one’s absence, but it can make the eventual financial struggle much easier to maintain so that more important matters can be handled.</p><p>These examples are just a few parts of a competent lawyer’s mastery of personal injury law. Others include motorcycle accidents, drunk drivers, spinal cord injuries, insurance bad faith and bicycle accidents.

Those who believe that their situations do not warrant obtaining legal representation may not be considering the many ways in which having an attorney on their sides can tip the scales in their favor. If you have been hurt in an accident and are seeking compensation for your injuries, you may want to consider the following factors prior to entering into negotiations without a lawyer.</p><p><strong>Complex Legal Rules </strong></p><p>Depending on your situation, your case may involve complex legal rules. Any missteps with these may result in the dismissal of your claim or the reduction of your compensation amount. One of the best ways of preventing such an occurrence is to consult with an accident attorney in Boulder, who can guide you through the process and make sure that you present your best case.</p><p><strong>Calculating Total Costs of an Accident </strong></p><p>Sometimes an accident results in a simple injury with a short recovery period. Many accident victims, however, suffer injuries that can last for the rest of their lives. These people may not know how to calculate compensation that addresses the long-term disabilities that they are now facing. Arguing for such compensation can be very complex, involving expert testimony, scientific data, and other intricate evidence. Having an experienced accident lawyer in Colorado handle the collection and presentation of such evidence often leads to better results for accident victims.</p><p><strong>Stronger Negotiating Presence </strong></p><p>Hiring an attorney can greatly boost your negotiating presence and power.

Ask any prospective lawyer exactly how many similar cases they’ve handled, and of those, how many they have won. While past performance certainly doesn’t guarantee future results, it will give you a good idea of your chances of winning, should you choose to move forward.</p><p><strong>How Much You Should Expect to Spend</strong></p><p>If a prospective injury lawyer immediately starts a discussion of what you should expect to pay regardless of the outcome of the case, you should probably reconsider hiring them in the first place.

Slip and fall injury statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that falls are especially a danger for people over age 65. One-third of the Americans in this age group suffer from a fall each year. In 2010, about 2.3 million older people were hospitalized for non-fatal injuries, while more than 20,000 were fatally injured.</p><p><strong>How Severe Are These Injuries?</strong></p><p>Although some falls are harmless, others can be devastating. Common injuries include fractures, head injuries, and lacerations. The CDC reports that falls are the leading cause of traumatic brain injuries, which can cause death or lifelong cognitive impairments. Falls are also responsible for more than 95 percent of hip fractures, according to the CDC.</p><p><strong>How Can These Injuries Be Prevented?</strong></p><p>Certain precautions can reduce the likelihood of fall injuries. The NSC recommends that people check their homes for tripping hazards like cords, rugs, and small objects. The CDC recommends that older people exercise regularly and avoid medications with side effects like dizziness. Unfortunately, in many cases, slip and fall injuries occur because a business or property owner failed to provide a safe walking area. This can happen when lighting is bad, flooring is wet, gaps are unmarked, or the walkway is cluttered. Victims are often powerless to see these hazards and are unable to avoid the resulting injuries.</p><p>Slip and fall accidents can cause lifelong injuries and even death. Unfortunately, slip and fall accident statistics indicate that there are millions of victims each year.

The following guidelines can help injury victims better understand who “possesses” the property:</p><p><strong>Duty of the Possessor</strong></p><p>It is the duty of the possessor to eliminate dangerous conditions on the property that may cause harm to anyone who enters the premises. The premises should be kept free of reasonably foreseeable risks that could cause injuries to invitees, licensees and even trespassers in certain situations. If a condition poses a potential risk, a possessor should, at a minimum, post warning signs alerting anyone who enters the property of the risk.

This and many other alarming <a name=\"motorcycle accident statistics\" href=\"http://sloatlaw.com/boulder-motorcycle-accident-attorneys\">motorcycle accident statistics</a> show the high number of deaths and injuries these crashes have caused in the past and continue to cause each day. One might ask, what are the causes of such an increase in motorcycle accident deaths and injuries? Perhaps less than the danger of the motorcycle itself, this increase may be attributed to an increased number of motorcycles on the road today, as well as the lack of safety measures followed by both motorcycle operators and other vehicles on the road. Increasing safety may only be a matter of increasing awareness.</p><p><strong>Impaired Driving Ability Due To Alcohol Consumption</strong></p><p><strong></strong>When operating a motorcycle or any other motor vehicle, impaired judgment and ability are inseparably linked to driving under the influence of alcohol or other controlled substances. Motorcycle drivers should be responsible for their own sobriety while operating these vehicles, and perhaps, should even reach out to other motorcyclists about remaining sober while driving.</p><p><strong>Lack Of Safe Head Protection</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Safe head gear means not only wearing a helmet, but also ensuring that any passengers are also wearing protective head gear. All helmets should be DOT approved. Proper helmets have been tested and proven to significantly reduce the amount of head injuries received by individuals in motorcycle accidents. If a helmet has been in a previous accident, it may no longer offer the right amount of protection to drivers and passengers on motorcycles.</p><p><strong>Driving At Unsafe Speeds Or In Hazardous Conditions</strong></p><p><strong></strong>For both motorcycle and other motor vehicle operators on the road, obeying all traffic laws and set speed limits is the first step to reducing the alarming number of motorcyclist deaths and injuries each year. By obeying traffic rules and speed limits, safer driving practices can be implemented to better protect all drivers on the road. Motorcycle operators should also be weary of driving in unsafe conditions such as on slick roads or on unpaved or gravely paths. Improving motorcycle accident statistics is up to both motorcyclists and non-motorcyclists alike. If you have been injured in a motorcycle accident, however, it is a good idea to speak with an experienced attorney.

Nineteen states have universal helmet laws—that is, riders and passengers must wear helmets at all times while riding. Twenty-eight states have partial laws, meaning that only certain categories of people are required to wear helmets—such as those under the age of 21. Three states have no helmet laws whatsoever. The best way to ensure rider safety would be to enact universal helmet laws nationwide.

Working to minimize the harmful and devastating effects suffered by victims of dog bites begins by trying to reduce the occurrence of dog bites in the first place. Dog bite attorneys in Colorado would recommend that dog owners begin training their puppy in good behaviors from the very beginning of dog ownership. Start by taking the following tips from experts in puppy training:</p><p><strong>1. Respond promptly to puppy biting.</strong></p><p>It is common for puppies to bite while playing and teething. It will be your job as the “boss” to teach that puppy that biting is never acceptable. Consequences shouldn’t be severe. Instead they should be consistent. In addition to reprimanding biting, try to focus on rewarding the behavior that you do want to see. In general, you’ll need to provide the following training before the puppies reach four months.</p><p><strong>2. Developing Trust and Respect Will Improve Training Results </strong></p><p>Without developing a relationship of trust and respect with your puppy<a href=\"https://www.east-inflatables.co.uk/p/004032.html\">Runt Run wholesale</a>, any instruction that you try to provide could be ignored. This is another aspect of establishing that you are the boss, the caregiver, or the top dog.</p><p><strong>3. Don’t Resort to Physical Reprimands</strong></p><p>Hitting, kicking, or otherwise hurting your puppy will erode the trust that you have worked to develop with your puppy. Positive reinforcement is a much more effective method of training no matter what you are trying to teach.</p><p><strong>4. Provide Socialization for Your Puppy</strong></p><p>This is one of the most important things that you can do to prevent biting and other aggressive behaviors. By providing plenty of socialization with strangers, new situations, and other dogs in the first months of the puppy’s life, you’ll be able to establish comfort in these situations and make it clear that you expect your puppy to behave in all situations.</p><p>While Colorado dog bite lawyers are ready and willing to help you after suffering from a dog bite, they would prefer to prevent the attack in the first place<a href=\"https://www.east-inflatables.co.uk/p/004032.html\">Runt Run wholesale</a>. When a dog owner hasn’t provided this training, turn to a Colorado dog bite attorney to get the representation and professional assistance that you need.</p>"

However, this is not always the case, as <strong><a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/boulder-slip-and-fall-accident-attorneys\" target=\"_blank\">Slip and Fall Accident</a> Statistics</strong> indicate that these types of accidents can occur at any location and are not always caused by ‘wet floors’.&nbsp; In addition, the recovery process for individuals who have encountered these types of accidents can be painful, lengthy and costly.</p><p>If you want to get the real picture about these types of accidents and their effect on the lives of ordinary people in the United States, then read on for some <strong>Slip and Fall Accident Statistics</strong>:</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"https://nfsi.org/nfsi-research/quick-facts/\">The National Floor Safety Institute (<span>NFSI</span>) statistics</a> indicate that slip and fall accidents are a common occurrence in the United States. They are the most common reason why most people end up in hospital emergency rooms.&nbsp; According to the <span>NFSI</span>, eight million people visit the emergency room each year due to falls. Out of these eight million visits, one million visits are as a result of slips and falls incidents.</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/walkingworkingsurfaces/\">Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),</a> a majority of the accidents that occur in the workplace and 15% of all accidental deaths are as a result of trips, slips and falls. These <strong>Slip and Fall Accident Statistics</strong> on accidental deaths (15%) are second only to the fatalities caused by motor vehicle accidents, making these types of accidents ‘grave’ (no pun intended).</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statistics from the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/falls/adultfalls.html\">Centers for Disease Control (CDC)</a> indicate that 20% of falls usually cause head injuries or broken bones. In fact, these statistics show that falls cause most traumatic brain injuries.</p><p>The ‘real picture’ portrayed by credible <strong>slip and fall statistics</strong> indicate that these types of accidents are more&nbsp;common than most people think. While they may seem simple compared to other types of accidents such as a car crash, these kinds of accidents may change your life forever. Whether you or your loved one has encountered a slip and fall accident at home, at work, at a commercial location or on a private property,&nbsp;you should consult an expert slip and fall lawyer, such as <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/contact_us\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Sloat</span> and Nicholson</a> personal injury attorneys, to provide you with the <a href=\"http://www.sloatlaw.com/faqs\" target=\"_blank\">legal help </a>you may need to help you get through the accident and its repercussions.</p>"
